00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For you to give some insight to our customers as to perhaps along the line of religious

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
perspective for modern man or perhaps the purpose of life, social life and beyond, from

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
your point of view, if it would be helpful to our, from our perspective.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, first I'd like to ask, I feel the difficulty in answering a question of this nature in

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000
a particular group situation is that various ones will be seeking different answers.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I would like to say that I will give the answer in the highest degree that I perceive.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And those that can hear will hear.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And those that cannot will someday also come to hear.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.800
The question that our side of the light would like to impress upon all of the human consciousness

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:28.600
is simply that the purpose of life is not at all what your perception would tell you it was.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.280
From your human perspective, looking out through eyes, physical eyes, you perceive life and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:51.440
its importance as being bound up in family, work, love in the personal sense, in the children's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.800
sense or in love of parents or love of country or love of good work or however it manifests

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
to you.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.960
Now while no one on this side of the light would say that we are wrong-motived, they

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:22.880
would say that as long as you believe this illusion, you will not be able to fully participate

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:33.360
in the broad ongoing teaching that the planet provides for you.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.120
What is meant by this is simply that your eyes lie to you.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.040
You are using, most of you, are using the wrong vehicle to see with.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.480
The vehicle that you are called upon to see with is the inner vehicle that has no form

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.040
of which you are aware.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.080
It is made up of spirals of energy field which we will not go into because when your eyes,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.120
When your inner eyes are developed enough to see them, then you will know within your own

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.520
mind what you're perceiving.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.000
But just let me say that when these inner eyes open, you will then perceive the world totally

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.720
differently from the way you do now.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.000
And in that new perception, you will become one with all of the great truths that the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.120
greatest of the teachers have passed down to you.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.680
You say, all of you, or some of you, you say countless times,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.200
"All is one. There is only one reality."

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.920
But if you are being honest, and if you will look carefully at your mind,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.000
you will observe that your thoughts deny that you truly believe it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.500
You act constantly in opposition to this basic idea.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.300
In these, you act not only as if you were separate,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.000
but that as if your mind is separate from other minds.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.500
It is bad enough to think that your body is separate from other bodies,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.300
but on top of this illusion, you compound it by feeling

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.700
that your mind is somehow a separate entity from the rest of the minds in the world.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:44.700
We would like to say that this is an illusion created by the ego for its own use,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.700
and if you choose to continue, that's fine. This is a matter of choice.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.700
There are certain delights to be found in seeing oneself as separate.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.460
And some of these delights are obvious.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.860
For example, if you happen to be in a fulfilling personal relationship, then you see the obvious

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.940
delight of feeling a one-to-one love.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.260
On the other hand, it must be seen clearly that if you move from a fulfilling relationship

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.740
to areas of that relationship that are not fulfilling, then watch carefully what your

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.740
mind does, because your mind then says, "Ah, it is simply this particular relationship that

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.740
has gone sour, so now I will go out and find another personal relationship that will then

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.740
be meaningful to me." And so it goes. Time after time, life after life, relationship

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.740
after relationship, one forgets and puts aside the pain and the suffering and forgets the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:04.740
and forget that the purpose of life is to understand that you are not an evil.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.740
It is as simple as that.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:15.740
The purpose of everyone in this room is to come to the awareness that you are not now and have never been an evil.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.740
I am very aware, having been incarnate for myself,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.940
I am very aware of the tremendous pull of the illusion.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:36.380
But having moved out of that illusion, I have come to tell you that it can be done.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.060
And if you are still caught in the illusion, rest assured it is because it is giving you

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.540
something that you deeply want.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:54.300
So don't beat your chest and cry to the gods and say, "You are not fulfilling me.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.020
You are not showing me the way."

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.260
The way is always there.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:07.220
But most of you, if you would be honest, would see that you are very content on some deep

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.140
level with what you are doing.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.380
It feeds you in some way.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.100
It makes you feel important and you see if all is one then no one is any more important

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.100
than anyone else.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.420
And this is something that the ego refuses to see.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:35.740
The ego maintains its power over you by promising you a special state.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.740
You are special if you are a separate ego.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.060
If you are not a separate ego you see, then where is the specialness?

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.060
What is your specialness lost?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.060
It doesn't exist.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.060
And that is something that the ego screams at.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.060
So, please be very aware that you get precisely what you want,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.060
that what your life is now is what you choose it to be,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.060
that the instant that you choose differently, doorways will open.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.060
We cannot tell you which doorways,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:18.060
because when the time comes, the combination of energies will be there for you and you will begin to experience something else.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:25.060
A way will open. But nothing can be done on our side until you ask.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:34.060
And I don't mean a superficial kind of a whimpering, but a real soul call.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:41.060
Any true soul call is always answered and answered instantaneously.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:55.060
So, I realize that many on the so-called spiritual path tend to feel that they are in some way special from the rest of mankind.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:02.060
This is a misuse of the spiritual path.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:09.060
Anything that makes you feel any way different from every other man is a misuse because there

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.660
is no real difference.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:18.860
But we tend to use these devices when one is in the body.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.620
We use these devices to separate ourselves.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.340
I would ask you all to be extremely careful about this.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.340
Some of you are in marriage relationships or in non-marriage but close relationships with

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340
mates.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:47.500
And herein lies one of the greatest misuses of the spiritual quest, which is the insidious

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:57.020
feelings that you emanate to your mates that make them feel less.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.460
I would like to say that things are not always as they seem.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.380
For example, the long-suffering maid who continually stays home

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:13.820
and takes care of the family so that the other party can go out to meetings,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:22.820
it is questionable, you see, who is really the more caring and the more dedicated.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:31.820
So be very careful in all of your thought processes as you go through these pathways that you

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:45.620
don't take on the really deadly habit of thinking yourself exalted because you have some glimmering

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.620
of spiritual truth.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:11:01.620
The overall meaning of life, earth life and beyond earth life.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.620
You did say that it was to get beyond the ego.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.620
I think that was a statement that you made as being a major purpose.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:23.260
But can you express anything regarding the overall purpose further than what you already

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.860
said?

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:36.780
I think that several members of the group are interested in what happens beyond the event

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.780
It's called that.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:46.780
And there's much written about this place.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.780
Most of it is erroneous.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:58.780
Because in order to keep these things, words have to be used,

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.780
symbols have to be called on, but really do not exist in a parallel fashion on the other side.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:12.780
So much of it is filtered and very foggy and therefore misleading.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:22.780
I think it is a fair assumption that most people, unless they are highly developed, highly aware,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:33.780
have an underlying fear of death and the whole process and the other, waking on the other side, as they call it.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.780
So, with that in mind, I will do my best, but again one has to understand that the symbols

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:52.780
given are going to be misrepresented by the woman because she simply doesn't have the

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.780
ability to translate these things for you.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:07.780
But let me just say that the moment of transition varies greatly with the person going off.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:22.780
And the degree of fear is measured with the, what shall I call it, the disorientation that is experienced.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:31.980
Some humans pass over with absolutely no change of perception, but they're very rare.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:40.080
Now, the main thing that you have to keep in mind is that when you move over to the other side,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.280
your consciousness does not explode into a tremendous difference than it was on this side,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.680
because you see, there really is no other end here. It's all the same.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.680
But in order to make any sense at all, we speak in these terms.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.680
But when the transition is being made,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.680
the general tendency of the human is to concentrate on the body form as long as it can.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.680
It is deeply suggested that those of you who can free yourself of that

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:19.680
and keep your awareness of your consciousness as your primary function at that time,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.680
at that time, that would be a tremendous help to you.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.680
Because you see, there is only fear in the body sense.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680
There is no fear in the consciousness sense,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.680
because your consciousness does not change.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.680
There's no alteration in your consciousness when you die.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.680
So, if you want to keep the flow of continuity as much as you can,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.680
and do your best to learn about this process as you're going,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.680
Then the suggestion is to really let the body take care of itself and do whatever it is

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.680
destined to do and keep your awareness highly concentrated, as power-packed as you can in

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680
your consciousness.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.680
Now, on the other side, it will differ.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.680
It is really difficult to make any statement about this type of thing.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:17.960
It is fair to say that what you envision it will be like, so will it be for a limited

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960
period of time.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.960
Because one of the great things that you will learn is that the mind creates.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.640
And as you are creating this type of a reality on the other side, you will realize that this

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.200
is what's happening, that your mind is creating something.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.200
But be that as it may, there isn't too much to say.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.200
It will all be taken care of. That is the primary thing that I think is of importance to all humans.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:55.200
It's to get a really deep feeling and knowledge within that just as you are sustained by the Divine Force while you're in body form,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200
you are sustained by the Divine Force when you are not.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:04.200
So the degree to which all of the people in this room spend the rest of their life here

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:18.200
creating this very definite, concrete almost, awareness of their oneness with the divine

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.200
force that is pulsating through them constantly, the less fear there will be, the less change

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:31.200
there will be, the greater the greater expanding and experience, the greater the experience

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200
will be on the other side.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200
By that I mean it will not be as limited.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.200
Someone who goes over with limitations as to who they are will experience those limitations

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.200
to some degree on the other side.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.200
But the ones who have really worked at feeling the tremendous harmony that sings to their

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:57.200
being here now in body form, we'll find that it is a continuing process and that it isn't

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.960
even so much even going as they say from one room to another, even that is too much of a

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:13.760
limitation. What does free them so much is the dropping of all of the physical which is

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:19.520
a tremendous relief. And this is what they experience as such a lightening because the

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520
It can be very cumbersome.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520
I think those last comments failed to get on the tape.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520
Now, I'm sorry to ask you to repeat the material on family relationships and parents and children.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520
I think it gave some important information.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520
with a child.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520
with a child.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520
with a child.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520
with a child.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520
with a child.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520
I think it's important to know that there are many ways in which you can have a relationship

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520
with a child.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:47.520
Now, I'm sorry to ask you to repeat the material on family relationships and parents and children.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.520
But I think it gave some points that would be quite important to some others.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.520
Are we ready?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520
Yes.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.520
Would you ask the question?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.520
Yes. What can you suggest is the best way for parents to help their children?

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:19.520
Well, I'll make a little more concise of a term, but basically I would like to suggest to everyone who is a parent or is thinking of becoming a parent

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.520
that their primary consideration must be to, if they wish to be truly successful in this,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:41.520
in the rearing of children who will be in harmony and who will have a joyful relationship to

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:49.520
life, that the thing that they really must do, if they find it in themselves to do, is

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.520
to develop this day and the next day and all days henceforward an actual living relationship

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:08.920
with the wisdom that is available in the moment. Now this is a very specific thing and not

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:17.360
something vague. Most of parents when they find that they are going to become a parent

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.520
or if the child is already born, or if some difficulty looms ahead,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.200
they rush around and they read books on so-called experts.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.040
And the data that they receive seems to them

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.440
to be helpful in some degree or other.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.320
But if they were paying attention,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.760
they would realize that there is no particular way,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.960
in an overall sense, of knowing how

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.960
to respond to each instance problem.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.960
Now, there is a way, you see, you are not alone.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.960
None of you have been left alone here to battle your way to awareness alone of what's right for you.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.960
That would be a very unfortunate, chaotic kind of universe that you were thinking of.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.960
But the fact remains that most of you enjoy this separate feeling that we've talked about before.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.960
You enjoy a sense of being a separate entity and you enjoy the power of making your own

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960
decisions.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.960
And as long as that is what you want, then by all means continue to make your own decisions

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.960
to decide every detail down to the last as to what you should do for your child.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:37.960
But for those of you who have come to the understanding through watching your own life,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.760
that perhaps you have made some mistakes,

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.260
that perhaps things could have been handled in a better way.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.060
Now, if you are one of those, this is for you.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.360
If you really have come to this understanding,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.360
and if you are really in enough love state with the child

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.160
to truly wish to serve that child the best you can,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.360
then I say to you, the best thing you can do

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:13.920
is to develop your tuning device so that the wisdom that is pulsating around you constantly

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.600
will be able to record itself in you and therefore you will know what to do.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.320
You see, it is not a mystery.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320
There are no mysteries here.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:31.120
A man beats his breast and screams to the sky and says, "I don't know what to do."

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.920
Well, that's because his mind has not been able to think of an answer.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.920
But rest assured the answer is there.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.820
And for parents, we are particularly concerned with the raising of children in this age

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.020
and the next few ages to come, because a lot depends on that, which is another subject.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.820
But a lot depends on what happens to these next few generations.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.920
And so any of you who can hear, we would ask you to hear this.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:07.080
In the moment, when your mind is still and you are totally attuned to what is present

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:14.960
in this moment, with no encumbrances of past thoughts, with no desire beating at you, but

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:23.000
simply in the quiet of each moment, you will be able to speak the things that need to be

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
spoken.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
You will be able to think the thought that should be thought

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and you will perform what the Buddhists would call a right action.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Now, your mind is incapable of knowing what is right action for everyone in a certain area.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
At least, I think that is true all in this thing.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
There are some human beings, of course, who have transcended, but

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Basically, the human condition is one of having a very narrow awareness of what is the best

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.680
thing to do.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:05.360
So if you choose to be in love and harmony with the total plan and then know that all

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.440
will be served at the highest, it is a very simple matter.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:17.640
You must learn to constantly stop your thought process, to place yourself totally, wholly,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.640
and you don't hear it.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.640
They say, "God speaks."

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
And you know, most people don't understand that.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640
They don't believe it.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.640
And the reason that they cannot experience the voice of God or the voice within or however

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.640
you choose to say it, the reason they cannot experience it is because they don't have the

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.640
power to hear it.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.640
And they don't have the power to hear it.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.640
They don't believe it.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.240
And the reason that they cannot experience the voice of God,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.440
or the voice within, or however you choose to say it,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.140
the reason they cannot experience it is because they're too busy talking.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.640
Now, by this I mean mental talking in the form of thinking,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:02.840
mental fantasy, hope, fear, past, future.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:15.440
All of these things tend to fill you to such an extent with your own material that God simply cannot get through.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:25.240
There is no one in a body that cannot, if they seek it, hear the voice of God. No one.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.640
And if you doubt me, then I will give you a challenge.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.920
Spend the rest of your lifetime, and when you cross over to the other side, tell me.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.920
I'll be there.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920
Good afternoon.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:49.920
Good afternoon, Dr. Romer.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.420
You ready for questions?

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.920
I am.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.920
The first question the woman has,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:05.920
She wonders whether you could tell her a little bit more about your relationship with her.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:11.920
Well, that's a very healthy sign.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.920
I've been waiting and hoping that something of this nature would come up,

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:30.920
because one of the things that I've been concerned about was her lack of inquisitiveness about me and my relationship to her.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.920
In the past, the questions have come from you.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920
The questions that you have raised, if I'm remembering correctly.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.920
And she hadn't asked on her own.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:56.920
I consider this a healthy question because it means that she is accepting me in a way that I think she has had difficulty doing in the past.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.920
So I'm glad to speak to him about this relationship.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:08.920
Basically what I think she needs to know and the question that is foremost in her mind is

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.920
I think in her terminology would be, "Am I her friend?"

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:21.920
And of course this is a very true statement. I've been her friend for a long time.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:49.920
It is also true that I am her teacher, but the thing that she's beginning to sense is the thing that is closest to the truth, I think, which is that until such time as she can stand in relationship with the divine, I stand closest to her and therefore serve as a channel for her.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:59.920
So, in a sense, I am just a vehicle at her disposal, and I think it would be helpful for her to look at it this way.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:10.920
Her big concern, of course, as it should be, is the concern of being taken over to such an extent that there would be no...

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:16.920
no feeling of her own self in this process.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:26.720
And I think that the more she realizes that this is just simply a, as I am a channel, she is a channel.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.120
And that it all comes from the one source.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:38.020
So if you could tell her that, I think she'd feel better about the whole experience that she's undergoing.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.320
She says she has had a very hard time with it.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.520
But as we've said before, this is very healthy.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:52.920
We would be very, very unhappy if she were terribly taken over with it, terribly obsessed with it,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:28:00.020
and this would indicate a tremendous degree of ego involvement, which would be troublesome for us.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.820
But this isn't true in her case, and I think it's healthy,

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:08.020
and in no way do I wish to discourage her checking out of the data,

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.020
her keeping alert to what is true that I think and what is not true.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.380
She needs to do this and I think it's healthy.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.820
So if you tell her that for me.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.740
Thank you.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.580
And I might ask, do you experience yourself in a form,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.500
does your consciousness take on a form that seems separate to ours on our plane?

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:35.820
Well, what really is,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.380
this is difficult to say, but what it is is a very compact,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:49.980
If you could see me, if this is the question, if you could see me, if I could materialize myself for you, I would be a very compact energy unit, you see.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:29:04.280
I would be very, very compact and I wouldn't look to you, perhaps, like a form, because you're used to a very different form, but I would be very, very compact, very liquid, very movable.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.280
I don't hold to any particular form at any time because thought changes that form instantaneously

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.280
and so therefore if I have a thought of one thing I can move into that form.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.280
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.280
I think so.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.280
It's a very fluid area that's affecting.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.280
We're told that consciousness always has to have a form through which it can manifest or express.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280
Well, this is very true.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280
This is true.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:36.280
Yes, it's very... I mean, when you speak in terms of the One, or the vast void, or whatever,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:50.280
that, of course, the both are true, because once you have placed yourself in total relationship with the Divine,

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:57.720
Once you, if I may use the word, merge yourself into that, then your consciousness can move

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.600
into infinite realms and change its form, you see.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.120
It's interesting that the myths that your culture, not specifically the United States

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.120
culture, but the Earth cultures have created.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:17.240
Some of the fantasy stories are about people that transform from one shape to another.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.560
and use it from toads to princes and so forth.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.760
But actually, this is a statement of fact.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.640
And on the higher realms, it's tremendously freeing

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.520
and very creative to be able to change form.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.400
And one of the tremendous helps of it

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.720
is that one doesn't become attached in any way, you see.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.640
As perhaps the physical vehicle doesn't learn into this,

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.240
because it seems so stable, so ongoing.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.960
Does this answer your question?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.040
Thank you.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.960
Then the next question that the woman has,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.560
could I continue to leave the house for the weekend

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.240
when Craig Ratchner comes to visit?

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.240
Well, it's good for her.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.240
She won't like to hear this, but it's fine.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.040
I think that I-- as you know, I hesitate very much

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:15.320
to make any predictions for a future event.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.620
But I think it's safe to say that this obsession on her husband's part will soon end.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:26.180
I think that the advent of the new house, which has just come into their life, will make a

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.180
difference to him.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.180
It will give him something to do.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.620
I think he will begin to move out of that tremendous influence.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:40.660
And so I say, if it is necessary, if she asks her husband and he says, "Yes, I want you

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.420
to go," then I think by all means, you should do so.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.420
And do so happily.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:52.820
You know, do so with freedom and say, "Fine, I understand. This is your need. It's beautiful. I'll go and do something, you know, that is important to me."

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.820
And not to make it up into a very large occasion.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.820
If she looks at it with the right perspective, she can have a wonderful time.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:07.820
You know, she can either come here to be with you, she can go to other people, or she can simply go on her own somewhere,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.820
somewhere, a place with a swimming pool perhaps that her daughter would enjoy.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.300
or if she looks at it in a positive way,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.420
she can have a great deal of fun.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.340
So I think she should do this.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.900
Now the thing that also would be helpful

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.660
is spend a little money when she goes.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.700
Tell her that.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.260
Tell her that.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.820
I think your husband changes mind.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.320
Yes.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.780
Make an outing, I would say.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.280
Yes.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.860
Just let her-- spend a little money.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.620
The next question is, do you have a short message that could be given to Alice Reines?

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.460
The one you gave before was not advisable to be given.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:56.020
Well, yes, I think it would be nice because I think she's waiting for something.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.060
So, let me think a moment on Alice.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.060
Please.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:12.140
It's harder you see when it's people that are not directly connected with the speaker.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:24.820
Well, I think what we should tell her is that we greet her with great love

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:33.740
and that we are aware of the difficulties that are at work in her life.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:40.740
that there have been various times in her life when we were very close to breaking through

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:51.020
and making a real contact with her, but at these crucial times, something within her

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:58.020
has withdrawn and closed it off. And so we are very hopeful that with this advent of her

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:07.080
new direction, this so-called course that she is going to take up, that we are very hopeful

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:13.180
that this will be the vehicle that will be used so that we can make this contact with

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.180
her.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:20.420
That there's a great deal that we would like to bestow on her.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:27.420
We would like to lighten her tremendous mood problems, of dark moods that she can get into

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.420
and if she has great trouble in listening.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.420
And we would be very helpful in listening to these and indeed would be very happy to help.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:45.420
But so far no real connection has been made that allows us to do that.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:52.420
Now the situation is quite different with her husband and this is one reason why his moves are so much lighter than hers.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:01.420
It's not any inherent dark astrological placement which is how she tends to look at it.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.420
It is not that at all.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:14.420
But the fact is that her husband has spent a great deal more time and energy with a thrust towards making a very fine and useful hookup.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:21.660
She has done so, but she has not devoted the same time and therefore her moods are much

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.820
deeper and harder to raise because she's working virtually alone.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:31.420
But this is her choice and we would so welcome a change in this because there's so much that

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:38.180
we would like to begin to teach her and share with her and we would like to assist her in

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.340
the most direct way possible.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:47.780
So tell her that we love her and that we're with her and hoping that all will begin to

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:52.020
move and lighten for her in the ensuing years.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.020
Thank you.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.020
You spoke of getting through to her.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:04.020
Is there any way that my wife and I, either or both of us, can be more open to guidance?

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:14.020
Well, it's not the same situation at all. I can't equate the three of you at all.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:24.020
It's a matter of, oh, let me compare. It's like a light bulb that's turned on when we speak of you two,

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:28.020
and a light bulb that's turned off when we speak of Alice.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:39.300
No, I think I have really nothing terribly concrete to say.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.460
I hope you're not disappointed.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:46.540
But no, I think just this continuing on.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.260
Now, of course, all of the data that

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.220
was given in the last two days, I'm sure you both heard it

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:57.700
and you both understood instantly the thrust of the moment.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:06.200
And as with every other being who has not reached the final state of total awareness,

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.700
we do always recommend this.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.700
Both of you do it in varying degrees of efficiency at varying times of the year,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.700
at varying times of the day, and so forth.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.700
But this is very normal fluctuation.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.700
But by all means, if you would like to make any change at all,

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:31.700
or not even a change, a continuous, I would suggest a much more hopefully consistent remembrance

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:41.540
of the moment and to place yourself in the power of that moment. I can use the word power

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:47.100
with you both because it is not something that you would misuse. This is not a word I would

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:54.100
recommend you to use to your group. Power is a very loaded word in your environment.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.600
The moment itself has the power, not we.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.100
That's exactly right, sir, and that's why we can use it with you.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.100
But to other people, they translate it as something that they possess.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.100
And this makes for great news too.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.100
Another question a woman has is,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.100
"How do any of us..."

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.100
Can we have a glass of water, please?

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.100
"How do any of us..."

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.100
The question is, "How do any of us

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.100
what jobs we should be in, and the work we should be doing,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.100
what particular job, I suppose.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.100
I think this is one of the--

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.100
as I observe human life,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:38.100
I would say this is one of the major questions that humans have,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.100
and very few of them seem to ask about it.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.100
So I'm very pleased that this one was raised,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.100
because there are a few things that can be said.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:59.580
Now, first and foremost, I think, there must be an understanding within the person that

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:06.580
often time a job that they have, they look on it as something God has given them to do.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.780
Let us take an example of a clerk in a Safeway store.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.380
Now many people, say this person is on the so-called spiritual path, they would tend to

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.620
to look on that job as something God has given them, you see, and therefore they stay in

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.620
it and so on.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:33.020
Now, this is a great misconception because oftentimes, you see, what the higher forces

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.940
want above all is for you to move with creative joy.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.940
This is one of their main aims.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:50.500
And one of the things that best helps a person in the body to have joy and creative awareness

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.700
is to having a so-called job that they enjoy doing.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.820
So I would say to someone who is in a job they really don't like, I mean not just a marginal

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.380
if you understand, but someone who is totally unhappy in their job, the chances are low

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.380
that they have placed themselves there on their own limitations.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:17.380
And if they would begin to look within themselves and ask, you know, again we come back to the

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.380
same thing.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:26.380
Most people in job situations are there because they're either comfortable or they're convenient

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:31.380
or they're afraid of any further expansion for fear they won't be able to handle the

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.380
new responsibilities.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.380
You see, there are many, many reasons.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:44.820
A fear of a decrease in income or loss of prestige to take a job, a lesser job will destroy their

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.820
prestige.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.820
These are all ego questions, ego attributes.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:41:00.180
And so the first thing that should be done is a very serious consideration as deeply as

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.180
they can.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180
Why am I here?

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.600
Is it because I am afraid?

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.720
So on, you know, considering all these possibilities and to look deeply at these questions, not

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.720
asking other people because other people can't answer them.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:23.120
If a woman has a prestige problem and would prefer to be in a poorly paid prestige position,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.680
she's getting what she wants, you see.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.640
Now when the paycheck arrives, then she's unhappy.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:35.640
But most of the time she sleeps because her biggest desire is to be in a prestige situation.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.140
Alright, so that's one type of answer.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.140
I hope I've covered that sufficiently.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:47.140
But the first job is to look critically, to remove the veils from the real situation,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.640
your own motivation, why you're doing what you're doing.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.140
If you find at the core of it that you really, the reasons that you're there are very superficial,

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:04.140
or fearful or egotistical or whatever, then you are open to go to the second stage.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:08.140
Now the second stage is then you say, "Well, what?

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.140
What in all this world would I want to do?

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.140
There's so many opportunities and so many choices."

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.140
Well, that's really not true.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:21.140
If they will look at their environment, they will see that they have certain limitations that they must work in.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.140
They have a certain amount of money they must pull in.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.140
They have a certain ability. You know, you cannot be a president of a corporation if you've never had any background.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:36.140
And God is not interested in placing everybody in corporate positions.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:40.140
You see, that is not one of the...

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:48.140
You see, they keep placing on God functions that are not his, that he never wanted, and has nothing to do with, you see, in a real sense.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.140
You get what you want.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.140
Believe me, the same law applies to all of the things that we've discussed.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.140
And it equally applies with your relationships, and it applies with your job, it applies in all these things.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.140
You're getting something that you want in any situation that you're in.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:12.140
So, if you discover after the self-analysis that these people do, that it really applies to you,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:18.140
certainly to the speaker it applies to her, and to, you know, anyone else.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:26.140
If you really deeply look at the situation and realize that the motives are not very exalted and you wish to move on,

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:34.140
then the second phase is simply a constant paying attention to a movement within your life.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:42.140
Now, oftentimes, the committee, as you call them, the forces, as I would call them,

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:48.140
Place before you, like a carrot before the nose of a donkey, an opportunity.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.140
It can come in the form of something they read in the paper.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.140
I mean, we use the physical mediums, you see, to teach us.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.140
All of the things don't have to come through beautiful astral nodes of harmony.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.140
No. I mean, we use what is there.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.140
And so we use newspapers. We use other people.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:09.140
You know, we use the radio, the television.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.140
And if they've made up their mind that they want to make a change.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:20.140
Now they don't run out, quit their jobs and sit around and wait for the committee to give them a new job, you see.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.140
But what they do is they've made up their mind that their motives are wrong.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.140
They make the best of what they're in, you see, they don't drop everything and move on.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.140
They make the best of what they're in.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.140
And then they keep all of their antenna out in listening.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.140
They listen within and they listen without.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:43.140
They listen to people, they talk, in other words they decided to make a change.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.140
Now the question remains, what are they going to move into?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.140
The word, I'm speaking a very literal translation.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:56.140
Now it is true that they also hear higher voices, yes, and they will do so as they move along.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.140
But let's just take the beginning stages here.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:05.140
The person who integrates their whole life around the idea that there is a higher wisdom that can help them,

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.460
that they are willing and lovingly going to surrender and submit to

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.460
and to turn their life over to it.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.140
What that means, very simply, when they say, "What do you mean?"

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:21.140
I know this teacher has asked questions often about surrender and what this means.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:26.140
And she had tremendous trouble with it when she was in a relationship with Swami Jyotish.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.140
Tremendous trouble with this word "surrender." What does this mean?

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:36.140
So I think this is a good time to speak to this point so that she can better understand

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.140
it and maybe it will help anyone else.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.140
I have no idea what Mr. Jody meant himself.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:49.140
I can only tell you that from our perception what surrender means is first coming to the

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:56.140
understanding that you yourself as a human entity with a limited mind and limited understanding

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.140
that you are not capable of making the best possible choice.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:06.140
Two, having made this understanding very clear to yourself,

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.140
being willing to call on a source outside and within,

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.140
you think of it as outside, actually very much within yourself,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:20.140
to call on a higher force to aid you.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.140
Now, when step number two is called upon,

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:42.140
on

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.140
whatever little bits you can do, do.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.140
And we will fill in the gaps.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.140
You see, it doesn't take a whole lot of movement on your part

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.140
to activate the energies on our part.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.140
But we cannot make one move without your help.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.140
We cannot do anything until you call.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.140
Now, just the slightest call brings the response.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.140
So, I think this is an important point.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:11.140
That faith, this word faith, is built by observing that it works.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:31.140
I

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:38.140
that it works and that's all that we ask.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:47.140
Thank you. Another question. Are all events in our lives God sent or does that only happen

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.140
when one has surrendered?

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:55.140
Well that too is a good question because most human beings don't really understand this.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:02.140
And unfortunately, I'm afraid a lot of people have very strange ideas about this.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:08.140
Um, alright. First of all, nothing happens outside of God.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.140
Alright? Because there is nothing outside of God.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:21.140
The place where it could be stated, which is, these are bad words, but where it could be stated that you and God separate,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:39.140
the

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:46.140
activate a choice without at all worrying about whether it is in harmony with the vow.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:51.140
Alright? So people always say, "How Hitler?"

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:57.140
If Hitler and God, if God is motivating Hitler and all of the situation in Germany, etc.,

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.140
well then what kind of a God is it?

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.140
Well the answer is simply that it's not God.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.140
It happens within God, yes.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:13.140
Yes, but it is not a will of God because when God, and this is cosmological and I hope it

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.140
fits in with what you're interested in, if not just tell me and we'll move on.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:27.140
But when the first creative impulse was with God in the form of what you would call a human

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:51.140
of

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:57.140
I mean, this is why people have trouble turning to God, because they think in terms of Hitler

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.140
and the tremendous chaos, etc.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.140
Do you understand?

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.140
Yes.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.140
I would like to state on behalf of the highest that I have experienced, that this is not

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.140
the truth.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:12.140
And if you would only learn this one lesson, that you have decided, you have been given

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:18.140
this individual creative power, and this is how you have chosen to use it.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:24.820
Once you change your mind, any one of you, to the slightest degree, and say, "I think

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.980
that I have created a devil.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.620
Look at what I've created.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.620
I do it differently.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.260
I don't want any part of this anymore.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260
Help me."

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:44.580
Then an actual movement moves into your mind and slowly and it is not really instantaneous

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.580
except for a very exalted few, who are very ready.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.580
But they're not likely to be in the dilemma that we're talking about either.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:51:03.580
So, for most people it is a slow process of moving, inundating slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly into the mind

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.580
and making changes, a slight change here, a slight change there, so forth.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.580
Do you understand?

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:16.580
Now, it is so sad that the great churches have tried so hard to reconcile the God and the devil and so forth.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:22.580
It is very simple, and I hope I've made it clear to you. It's very hard to put these things in context.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.580
It's a choice of a so-called separated consciousness.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:33.580
That's exactly right. Now that consciousness at any time can say, "I don't want this. I want to go back to the source. That's what I want."

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.580
Now he doesn't have to go anywhere because he's never left it.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.580
You see, so it's merely a movement of going nowhere.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.580
A journey that you don't move at all.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:48.580
But at the same time, you see, just as you were given...

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.580
You see, the Father has will.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.580
The Divine has will.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.580
You have will.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.580
Very simple.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.580
If you had no will, then you were not like the Father at all.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.580
You see, because you would have no will.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:07.220
The problem comes that we have watched this drama of humans acting out of their own separate

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:14.780
wills and completely turning, literally turning their minds away from the will of life, which

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.740
is the will of God and harmony in the world.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:22.420
So once one decides, "I don't like what I have created," because you have created it,

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.900
then you simply choose something different.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:30.900
The minute you say, "I don't know, you know," speaking not to another human but to the vast

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.900
wisdom, "You know, please help," then you can say with grave certainty, "Everything

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.900
happens by God's will."

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.900
Until that time, that is not a statement that can be made.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.900
It happens by your will.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.900
May I?

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:46.900
Certainly.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.900
Isn't this exactly what you're saying, as I understand it?

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.900
Isn't this exactly what we had in the stories of the prodigal son?

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900
Oh yes!

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.900
He was never apart from his father.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.900
He was always his father's son.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.900
But his will turned him away from his father so that he forgot it.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.900
And as soon as he turned back and said, "In my father's house is everything.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.900
I will to go back in his father's tomb."

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.900
Praise God.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.900
Thank you.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.900
Praise God.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.900
There's no other meaning.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:22.300
And you notice in that story, it's the resentment of the brother that stays home.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:22.800
Yes.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.300
All right.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.980
Now that's an interesting point too, because so many people--

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.500
that brother was just as separated in his own mind from his father

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:32.660
as was the wanderer.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.300
And that's--

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:33.800
Yes.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.300
Yes.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.260
That's very case-based.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.980
Love to say that.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:45.060
You have mentioned your influence for GER or the fire forces.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.600
Can we be affected by negative influences, by lower forces?

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.600
Through me?

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600
No.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600
That was a good question too.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:59.640
The answer is no, not through me, because of the protection that surrounds.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.640
I never would have attempted this type of teaching.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.640
But under ordinary conditions, can a person be affected?

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:13.640
Some say there is an organized evil in the universe, which I never was willing to accept,

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.640
but it's a commonly held belief.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.640
And that these forces can influence us,

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.640
or at a lower stage than that, or a lesser stage,

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.640
we can be influenced by ignorant spirits.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.640
Ignorant forces.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.640
Well, first of all, there is no organized evil.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.640
There is no devil.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.640
There is no such thing at all.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.640
At all.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.640
That is my feeling, but...

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.640
Well, your feeling is right, because you see, all of those are separate.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:57.640
Now, what is true is that there are entities or thought forms or clusters of thought forms

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:06.640
which have a very negative outlook generated through various conditions which we won't go into.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:12.640
Now these exist both on the earth plane and in many planes you will ever be in.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:22.640
But this is really not the terrible demon that the humans make it into.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:29.640
And what really happens is, let us take, as happens often,

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:36.640
Let us take a human entity who has perhaps been silently, without telling anyone, having

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:41.640
some kind of a war within themselves between the dark and the light and good thoughts and

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.640
bad thoughts and, you know, a whole great deal of battle going on.

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.640
All right.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:54.640
Now, at some time in this battle, a conscious decision, and I repeat, a conscious decision

00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:01.640
is made to experiment with the energies of the dark, what we would call the dark.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.640
And they are called on.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.640
Nothing can happen that you do not call on.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.640
You see, the same law applies that applies to the highest, it must apply to the lowest.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.640
You must call it on.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.640
You must call it forth, or it will not enter.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.640
And just as you cannot expect the God force to move into you just in its own volition,

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:28.640
you must call it, by the same law you must call on the forces of dark for whatever reason.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640
Alright?

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.640
So this is something that they often do as an experiment.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:44.640
You know, there is a tremendous attraction in some people for experiencing a dark vibration.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:53.140
It carries with it a certain tone quality that is different.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.140
Black magic sort of thing.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:03.140
That kind of thing. It has a vibration to it that is very stimulating to the physical body.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:10.140
You know, it's in your terminology, it gives them a jazz, or whatever I've heard that.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.140
You know, the same thing.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.140
Now, so it is a conscious choice.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.140
The problem comes when they get in the middle of the stream,

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.140
they've called these dark forces in,

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:23.140
they've experimented with them,

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:28.140
they've gotten a certain amount of familiarity with it,

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:33.140
they've gotten their so-called "jows" or whatever from it.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:40.140
And then, they start feeling their body getting destroyed,

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:48.140
their mind getting very, very chaotic usually is a way they experience it.

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:54.140
And they are not always able, and this is where the sad part of it comes,

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:59.140
they are not always able to then have the awareness to call on the forces of life

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.140
to come in and change it.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:05.140
Because you see, if the balance is overreached, even to a slight degree,

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:12.140
degree and the negative is so much in larger proportion than the light, then of course

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:20.460
they're not willing to leave. They have feelings of their own, you see. They are not some amorphous

00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:27.460
thing that has no feelings. They have a movement of their own that they have established now

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:32.020
with this form. So what can happen and what you would call

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:39.020
Now what happens in this case is, if enough people or even one person of sufficient strength,

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:50.380
now power is important here, sufficient power of the good, can somehow be willing to participate

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:58.340
in a real communion with this person. I'm not speaking of a physical communion, I'm

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:04.340
really speaking of a mental hookup with this other person. Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:11.340
And if they would then move their tremendously stronger proportion of the light, which then

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:18.340
is part of this other person's small, diminishing power of light, and at that time in the name

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:23.340
of this other person and themselves, because they are one, you know, we're not whatever,

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:29.340
This other person would then call on the light and the light then moved in and he would begin

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.340
the process of moving the dark.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:42.340
So it is a very difficult thing to do.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.340
All of your great teachers do it constantly for their disciples and this is how their

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:54.340
the disciples feel so much better often in the presence of a really great master.

00:59:54.340 --> 01:00:00.340
Because what he really is doing is moving his light into your dark, you see.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.340
He's helping, you know, get the balance going in the opposite direction.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:09.340
The problem is, of course, this cannot be done on a continuing basis.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:15.340
You cannot just... so it's a conscious movement on his part.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.340
You can't keep that up continually.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:23.340
So, therefore, then you really do have a quotation here on the earth plane, I think.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:32.340
Being with a guru, if you're in his physical presence, you tend to feel higher than you do at other times.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
And that's why.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:38.340
Now, understand that this... Let us go back to this first energy we're teaching them.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.340
They're called on the dark forces.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.340
The exorcist or whoever it is that is doing this to heal and so forth.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340
Yes, yes, the demons.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.340
Right. They cannot stay there.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:57.340
You know, they cannot continually keep in this state of communication.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:04.340
So when they withdraw, now that person is back on his own free will again.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.340
You see? You always really must make these choices for yourself.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.840
No one can make this for you, otherwise free will would be a joke.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:19.640
So, but, but you see the difference now is they have another, in terminology, another chance.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.640
You see, they've had another chance to work with it.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.640
This is why the way that the insane are worked with is so insane.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.840
[Laughter]

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:35.040
Well, this, this would be a little perhaps like helping a child to learn to walk.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.040
We take his hand and help him to get up.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.040
But we're never going to walk if we don't let him go again.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040
That's true.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
That was the same thing.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.040
It is that total...

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.040
But it's even more difficult for you,

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.040
in a sense, of taking and putting your consciousness,

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:01.040
because you are aware that there is a force there.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
A dark force is there.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040
And you must be willing.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.040
And that is why it's so foolish for people without sufficient light within themselves,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.040
without sufficient understanding and power to enter into this kind of thing.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040
And we see it from our side constantly.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:27.040
Very, very unprepared people try to move into this area, and what happens is that they're transformed.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.040
You see?

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:40.040
Alright, example. Let's go back to our first entity who has a great deal of dark permeated with just a very slim opening of light.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:48.040
Another person comes in and enters into this who themselves doesn't have as much light as their ego would imagine. Alright?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:55.040
Now if those two move together and if together the predominant is darker, then they are both in it.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.040
They both have now shared the darkness. You see?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
They both have too much.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:09.040
So, this is another subject entirely, but it is one of the things that concerns us a lot.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:18.040
And the arrogance of certain so-called healers or so-called spiritual people who feel that they can go into...

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.040
You see, they half believe they can do it and they half don't. You see?

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.040
So they go in and they are able to work this situation and deal with it.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:39.040
Now I would like to ask whether you have any suggestions for Joy, who is a member of our

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040
Quest group, and especially in her relationships with the child, first for her spiritual growth

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.040
both and also for the relationship.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
Mm-hmm.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.040
Well, I agree with her.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.040
I agree that she is a friend.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.040
I know this woman.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:05.040
Um, my first statement is that you do not have to worry too much about the daughter.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.040
Mm-hmm.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.040
Um, the daughter is at a time...

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.040
Which daughter are we speaking of?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.040
Cindy.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:28.480
The daughter is at a very fluctuating stage of her own life and if I may be blunt, I hope

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.920
the daughter doesn't hear this place because I don't think it would be terribly helpful.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:39.120
But the daughter is, in your terminology, playing a lot of games at this stage of her life.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.120
She's coming into a certain amount of power as all she is is good.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.120
And she's willing it now here, now there.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.120
And her mother is in the line of fire once in a while.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:05:00.120
I think the biggest help in this whole drama of what spiritual path to take

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:06.120
are suggestions of joy to let her do whatever she pleases and to make absolutely no comment.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:13.120
You see, once a child really realizes it's totally her own choice, and that she can't

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:20.120
in any way be in an antagonistic situation about it, you see, it's simply her own choice,

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:26.120
then she may become more serious about her own choice.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:33.120
Now, the problem comes, as I perceive it, the problem comes that Joy is very much attached

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.120
attached to the good opinion of this daughter.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.420
And she wants the daughter to think well of her and so forth.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.840
And we say, well, don't worry about that.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.800
Don't worry about that.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.840
Make it very clear to the daughter

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.800
that she has free choice and so does joy.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.200
That if her daughter gives her the feeling

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.440
or makes the statement that joy is in jeopardy of her soul

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.280
or whatever-- it might be the way this would be worded.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.280
I'm not sure how it would be stated.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.280
Then Joy's comment should be very calm, and very simple, and very strong.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.280
I stand responsible for my choices as you do.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:21.280
And if I have made an error, I will stand responsible.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.280
And it's really not your concern, my dear.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280
You see?

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.280
There has to be a statement made so that the child will quit wasting her time.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:36.280
because in a sense she's playing a game, you see the child playing a game.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.280
And it's pretty dejorious, at this time.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.280
So do you think that covers the child?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280
Yes.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.280
And she has to know within herself when she makes the statement.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:53.280
My dear, it's my situation. I will be responsible.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Thank you for your concern, but I don't really need your concern.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.280
I think you should be worrying about yourself because your own life is about to be placed in your own hands.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:10.280
And so why don't you spend your time, you know, concerning yourself about your own life.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.280
Anything else about, like, for joy or other, like, other words?

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.280
Well, I think joy is doing fine. Now, I don't know if joy feels good.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.280
I'm sure she has frustrations at times, but we are very good.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:34.280
But it's been a tremendous change in my perception in the last year, and the light is moving through her and you can see it as you envision her.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.280
You can see it in her face, I think, as we see that.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.280
And I think this is a very significant movement for her.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:51.280
I think that it is time for her to give serious consideration to a specific discipline.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:58.280
I'm not meaning that in the negative sense of no need and no sexual relationships and no wine and so forth.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.280
That isn't what I'm referring to.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.280
I'm referring to an inner discipline.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:11.280
I think she's at the stage where she could make a selection based on the best response that she has at this time.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.280
She has quite a good array to choose from.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:24.280
you know, she has various methods, so-called methods, that she has read about or heard

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.280
about or that you've told us about. And I think that for the next few years, I mean

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:33.280
she doesn't have to make the choice that will last her a lifetime, you know, do you

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:40.280
think? But I think she needs to begin a very definite, definite approach to something.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:47.280
And whatever feels the strongest within her being, as she reviews them, then I think she should try this.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:54.280
Now, if she tries one and it doesn't seem to be working for her, she should feel very free to drop it and move on to something else.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280
These are not such tight compartments, these are.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:08.280
And I think, well I know, I know, and we feel very strongly that she's ready for a very serious commitment to some kind of definite discipline,

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.580
whether it be even something as simple as a definite meditation time every morning,

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:16.580
even if it means she has to rise before the family or...

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:24.080
In other words, a strong trust on her part will begin to bring results.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.580
And then the results, of course, will increase her desire to do it.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.380
You know, we're very tricky.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.280
That would be a symbol of commitment, which would encourage her on the road.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280
That's the point.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.280
I mean, she needs to make this symbol of commitment,

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.780
but mostly for herself, to say, yes, I commit to this.

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.780
I'm willing to do this.

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.280
This is what I want to do.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.280
I know it will be difficult. I won't always want to do it.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.280
But this is what I'm doing now, and please help me.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:52.280
And constantly turning within.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.280
You know, she can do that very well.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:01.280
And another question about another one of our quest groups, Doris,

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.280
who has been a serious speaker, I think, for some time.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Any suggestions for her further growth?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.280
Well, now Doris is different.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:18.280
Doris is really a different situation.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.280
Doris has made a commitment.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:29.280
Doris has made a commitment on a deeper level to the light in the past.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:36.280
It's true that she hasn't made a commitment on the surface area, as you see.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:43.280
We would not call for any particular strain that she belongs to in one of the rays at this time.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:52.280
But the commitment has been made within herself, and I think that the situation differs.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:11:05.280
One of the things that Doris really puts best benefit by, and I think she has inklings of it, is she has very good perception.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:13.280
And in her perception, if she could constantly do what I suggested on the tapes of yesterday,

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.280
the moment to moment, opening to the moment, is Doris' way.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.640
and she can do it.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.400
And she is so much more prepared to do it than most people.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.520
There might even be a reluctance on her part

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.480
to really immerse herself in doing it

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.960
for fear of not being able to fulfill responsibilities

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.200
of one kind or another.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.800
I don't think she should worry about that.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.440
But that might be a fear.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.080
And if it is, would you please tell her

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.880
that there is no need to fear, that all these transitions are

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.880
and her entire life situation will begin to adjust.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.880
Now you see, I would like to introduce another error that humans make.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.880
They look at the situation in the reverse.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.880
They say, well if my situation outside would change,

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.880
then I will then be able to make my commitment.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.880
By this time they say, if I was given a house that had a meditation room in it,

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880
and I would begin to meditate.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880
Alright?

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880
Now,

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.880
I'm glad you're all glad you see the point.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880
It's very, very simple,

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880
but many people don't see this.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880
They say,

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.880
"If I didn't have the kind of job I have,

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880
then I could give it

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.880
a moment-to-moment awareness."

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880
Now,

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.880
the reverse is true.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880
We are not going to go about

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
bouncing people from job to job

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880
and house to house

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.880
unless we know

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.880
that the commitment is so strong

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.880
that that is what's necessary,

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.880
Be sure, and I would like to assure anyone who is a truly serious teacher,

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.880
if they will make the slightest effort toward any of these things,

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.880
if their job is in depth, if their job is truly a hindrance,

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.880
their job will be canceled.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Alright?

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:07.880
Once they put out the call that says, "My life is yours, whatever you wish, I will do."

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.880
Once that call is remade from the heart, all things will change.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.880
You know, the speaker may wonder why she's been given another house.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:21.880
And she shouldn't wonder, because she's made this call, and she has sat in her living room

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:28.880
and been unable to have even the slightest corner for a solid seat when she's in the midst of a teen household

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.880
that all looks to her for support. Even in her sleep, they're asking her for support.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.880
She has no place of her own, but she has a place now because she has a teen house.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.880
And she will be able to leave that green house, sit down, and meditate, and she won't be able to hear.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.880
And she didn't think of that when the house was...

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880
In fact, she didn't even think of the house if her husband was with her.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.880
But this is the point. Do you see?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.880
This is the kind of thing that we will take care of.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.880
And the same is true in Dorothy's case. It's true in anyone's case.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:07.880
If there is something in their life that is their real limitation, their real hindrance, we will take care of it.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:22.880
But we will not take care of it unless they begin the process and show that they are dedicated to the pursuance of it to the point that, if I may be perfectly frank, that it's worth our time.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:30.880
We're not going to continuously be doing these things when the recipient just says, "Oh, thank you very much," and then forgets all about it.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
We need to have this consolation.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:44.880
Now, many people in your group and many people in the world are under the impression that life is a crystallized future.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.880
And that it's just a series of events that they move through, like in a chronocon.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.880
This is totally untrue. This is totally untrue.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.880
It isn't even true that you're necessarily going to meet people.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.880
That, you know, that's another one of the things that they say, "Well, it was destined that we meet," and so forth.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.880
Well, it is true that the people that you do meet and that have a tremendous influence in your life, there has been destiny in that, yes.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.880
It's a pre-planned arrangement.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.880
But also it is true that there are people whom you were to have met that you have not met.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:23.880
You see, this story that when the student is ready, the teacher appears is very true.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:31.880
There are many people who we have hoped would have teachers that they could meet either on this train or on the next.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.880
you know, either through some kind of a dream revelation

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.880
we work with dreams often in order to convince people of things

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880
but either in the dream state or just merely in a medicated state

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.880
and in physical life if they really need one

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.880
if they need one in physical form

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.880
that they have a network

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.880
and the reason is that they have not used what they've been given

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.880
so therefore it doesn't happen

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:04.880
You see, nothing is so preordained that we can assume that we will be taken through like

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.880
a queen in a coat down the street.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880
You know, it isn't so.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.880
One has to make one's commitment over and over and over again.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.880
When you realize that you have failed in a commitment, instead of spending one moment

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.880
saving against yourself, just begin to do that which you are feeling badly about not

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.880
doing.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.880
And so on.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.880
That's wonderful.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.880
Anything else for us to do?

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.880
You have lovely children.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.880
Oh, thank you. Thank you, dear.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.880
Well, I was expecting all four of them.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.880
Yes, because I have an acquaintance with the other two.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.880
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.880
Is there any meaningful message that you could give them from them?

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.880
No, they're not. They're truly passed on.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880
They moved way on.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.880
And they're just wonderful.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.880
And I just wanted to be on the right in contact with them.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880
There's nothing to worry about.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880
They look forward to it, by the way.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.880
The speaker today, we were laughing on this side,

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:17.880
the speaker today was startled when she said to you in a conversation,

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.880
"Won't it be wonderful when you pass over and the boys will be there?"

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.880
And we were laughing because of course that's the fact.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:35.880
And it will be wonderful, but they have, they're not close now, they're in wonderful realms.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.880
Would you have anything to say to our daughters that I'll be seeing this week?

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Well, one would be a bit doubtful, but send her our love and the love of the boy.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:55.880
And to Nancy, who would be left out, I'm sure you want this?

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880
Yes.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880
Okay.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880
She's too busy.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880
Yes.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.880
And it's fine, let's keep her occupied and so forth, but we would be happier if she settled

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.880
down a little because she has so much, oh, so much potential in the spiritual world.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.760
But she's too busy, and we don't like to include such things.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.960
But since you asked, I will take this opportunity to say that she's too busy.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.920
She should have a greater period of quietude for herself.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.400
There's so much that would make her life so much more meaningful

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:35.880
than all of this that she's doing, you know, the medical business and the...

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.640
There's something else that seems to be in her mind that I...

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.640
Well, it doesn't matter. But whatever, all these things that are in her mind now, that are filling her soul,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.640
if she would give us a chance, we would fill it with something much more worthwhile.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.640
Something that would give her a great deal more joy. Let's put it that way.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:02.640
But is it because she feels a sense of obligation to try to help to provide for the family?

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640
That's a great deal of a deal.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.640
But you see, it's because she doesn't believe in us, either.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.640
If she believed in us, she'd know that we'd help.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.640
But then again, what we've just spoken of, you see, this commitment that we were speaking of,

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:22.640
the fact that she is doing it herself, then we have to allow her to do it herself.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.640
When the time comes, as I suspect it will, soon, when the time comes that she says,

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:37.080
no part of my day is for the divine and turns that over then then we can begin

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:45.760
but we cannot begin until she is ready for it. Would there be any significance what about the

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:53.080
Baha'i group to which she has been devoted to a certain extent anyway is

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.480
Is that a good commitment there?

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.680
Well, it's weak.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.400
It's not strong.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.040
Her commitment is not strong.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040
It's not strong.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.240
And the reason is that she's really not an organization

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.480
person.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.360
She's an individual person.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.920
She's a very private person.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:13.600
And it's this kind of person that we work the best with,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.440
you see, because she is best able to listen to us.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.640
And she would be able to make a very clear hookup.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.040
But she's just happy taking time.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.940
You know, the organization is again a busyness.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.440
And that isn't really what we want.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
We don't want busy people.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.540
We need people who are able to be in quietude

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.240
when that is what it's called for,

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.140
and to be dynamic when that is called for.

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.440
But the ones who are always into being dynamic

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.840
usually run out of energy on a deep level

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.840
And I don't have any way of replenishing it from the highest source, which your daughter

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.840
could do.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.840
I mean, she's an extreme, I'm sure you're dancing.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840
She's extremely receptive.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:08.840
And you might take this tape if you wanted to and play it, and we love her.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.840
And we're waiting.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840
But she's too busy for us.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.840
You tell her she's too busy.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.840
Well, we really appreciate it.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840
Thank you.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840
Thank you.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840
Thank you.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840
Thank you.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840
Thank you.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.620
Anything else before we go?

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.580
No, but this is our last time for a while

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.300
because the speech is ending.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.900
But I look forward to next time.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.980
I was going to ask one question.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:33.900
That in case the trustees could arrive,

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:39.700
would it work well for you if I would use the-- if I took over

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.460
the induction and would be able to contact you,

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.380
would it work for you?

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:43.880
Certainly.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.380
Certainly.

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:46.660
Well, you are very much a one unit.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.160
Yes.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.560
And the speaker has the same trust in you as she has in him.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.260
In fact, she loves you equally.

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.160
Thank you.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.260
And that's a lot.

01:21:55.260 --> 01:22:02.760
Would you suggest to this time that she be totally relaxed and totally relieved

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:08.760
and that any anxiety about any misinformation, she mustn't worry.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.960
Her prayer was that she would only give the highest and best for somebody.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.460
Yes.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:24.460
