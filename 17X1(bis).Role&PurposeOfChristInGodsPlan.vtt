00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
5th of May 1978 and the beginning of a session with the Corona Mexico.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're being recorded. Please.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Good evening.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Good evening.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Please, please sit down.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're pleased that you're here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We have a long way to go.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm very pleased to be here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Thank you.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Thank you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're excited to be here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We've got some big questions in you, sir, and we'll proceed whenever you're ready.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Very good. I do have a number I would like to ask for participation.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Would you come up close to the microphone so that we can be all in sync?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes. Could you speak on the question of the purpose and the role of the Christ and the Christ's teaching

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in God's plan for mankind and its evolution?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Well,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
there is so much, of course, but

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we shall try to respond to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
what we sense are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
your deep questions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Would you exchange places with this gentleman?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Certainly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It works best if I can speak in your direction.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We will... the question is vast, so we will limit it to what we feel are the deep questions within your consciousness, if that is alright with you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Excellent.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.000
First, it is, I'm sure, very obvious to you as you look back on your life, that although

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
you have tried to deviate at one time or another into other streams, can we proceed?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Sorry.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The color of the flow is blue. Each of the great forces that you call religious institutions,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.360
religious sciences, whatever, carry a color. And in the case of the Christ flow, it is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:05.040
a very deep and vibrant blue. This is an interesting color for you, in that I would suspect that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.040
that you have had experiences throughout your lifetime that may harmonize with this color.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.540
Is this a true statement?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.040
This is very true.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.040
So, all these years as you pull yourself to and fro in an attempt to find the center of your quest,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.040
you go off and then you return once again.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.040
This is a wise selection in your case, sir, because the way of the Christ is your way.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.040
And, now this is not true, of course, of David's gentleman on my right.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.040
But, so all of this is mostly directed at you this evening, this section of the tape.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:06.040
The place of the Christ in the world, as far as a religious force, at this time the Christ is taking the first place,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:16.040
the greatest place, the strongest place, because it is the current that is most needed at this time.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.040
The current of the Christ represents the current of the greatest love.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
I am speaking of the deepest forces of love that are manifested in the universe.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.040
And it is the Christ flow that most represents this particular strain.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Let us take, for example, the strain of the Buddha.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.040
Now, the Buddha represents a different flow, it is a different force.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.320
force. And the earth is in a cyclical movement and at this time the cyclical movement is

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.160
toward this deep need for greater love. Do you understand?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.440
Yes, sir. And this is why this particular force, this

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:10.960
particular vehicle is being used. This explains, by the way, the great upsurge of the Christian,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.000
what they call the Christian Church, the charismatic movements that are sweeping not only the United

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.320
States but various parts of Europe.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.040
It is because the need is so desperately great at this time for the human vehicle to develop

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.440
the, what we would call, the heart situation.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.160
And therefore, the reason that the Christ moves into the forefront at this time is that this

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.640
the greatest strength of his teaching.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:50.000
What particular strain of this would you like to deal with?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The subject is that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.240
Well, I was thinking in terms of the Christ teaching that no one comes to the Father except

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240
by me.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.240
Could you interpret that?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.240
All right, now, when the historic Christ spoke those words,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:21.240
he was speaking from a reality of the moment to the people that were gathered around him,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.240
and it was a literal truth.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.240
The hope of what was to become their salvation depended entirely on him,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.240
on his words, on what he would say, literally their salvation depended upon that.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:47.240
It is equally true to say that millions of people throughout the world who are incarnate now and have been in the past and will be in the future,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.240
their only means of salvation are through his words.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:07:01.040
The reason is that within each entity incarnate there is a certain tuning quality, a certain

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.360
responsiveness that responds to a certain vibration.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.120
And when he said, "No one comes to the Father except by me," whoever hears those words and

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.000
feels a resounding vibration within their being, that is the absolute and valid truth

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.760
for that person. Now, it may be that another person standing next to this individual hears

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.720
the same phrase and it falls as if on deaf ears. The reason is that there is within that

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:41.040
other entity another vibrational force that speaks equally deeply and purposefully to him.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.040
What must be stressed over and over again is that there is no conflict between these two

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040
forces.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:57.120
They stem from the same river and flow into different areas.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.400
And this is all to the joy of mankind because all of you, you know, you're not all the same

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.560
in the sense of the way that you have chosen to manifest.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.560
And some are very much drawn to one aspect and certain ones to others.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:22.920
It would be a very limited and unfair God who would ask that all of his creation respond

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:31.440
to only one kind of a vibration, because there are at least seven main ones, some of which

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.800
you may be interested to know have not yet come into the Earth's form.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.720
In other words, the Earth does not really know some of them that are here at the time.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:51.700
So the thing that we, on our side of the line, are so interested in expressing, and something

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.760
that I think, sir, you have been concerned with, is when you hear the words, "No one

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.960
comes to the Father except by me," does this then mean that, say, the Mohammedans and so

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.960
Are they then in some way in jeopardy of salvation?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.960
The answer is no.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.960
But the answer is equally true that for you, for you so much, this is a very vital truth

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.960
and you should follow it until the end of your day.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.960
The way to the light for you is through Christ.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.960
And you will reach it, sir, in case you have any deep questions about yourself.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960
I would like to clear them up a bit, sorry.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.960
Your past has been extremely interesting.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.960
Are you interested in it?

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960
I certainly am.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.960
Your past has been extremely interesting.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:55.960
You have had certain lifetimes of incredible emphasis towards the awareness of the One.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:05.420
And then in the following lifetime it's almost as if you feel the backlash of that tremendous

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.420
push that you've made.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.140
And it's been very erratic if you follow me.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.700
One lifetime you will go so far as to have in one time been a martyred saint.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.180
I don't know if you're aware of that, but this is a true part of your past.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.180
Were you aware of that?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180
I hadn't been told this.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.180
Well, it's true.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.860
You should accept it as true.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:31.180
But then in the following life, sir, it was a backlash back into, again, into a lower

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.860
form of understanding.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.060
And so your incarnative patterns have been erratic.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:44.580
Now the call at this time in your life is this lifetime you are being called to cease

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:55.060
this erratic behavior and to merge every moment of your life in a very calm and deliberate

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.840
movement toward what you can achieve, which is, if you wish for it, this life can answer,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.860
you are capable of total awareness of the One. Now, I say that to very few, but I say it

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:15.720
to you because we feel you are very much in need of knowing this, that you have self-doubt

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:27.260
in this area that has kept you from trusting into your own ability and you tend, if we

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:36.660
may make only one small criticism of you, you tend to listen to other people too much.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:42.860
And this is not for you, sir. You have embodied within you, you see, you have a brilliant

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:50.860
mind, all right? That is one gift. And we would ask that you meditate on that, because

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.940
your brilliant mind has been given to you for a reason. You know, it is not a matter

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:04.380
of chance. It is a matter of design. And so we would ask you to meditate in the ensuing

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.380
on how you can best use this incredible mind that you have.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.380
Now, that is one part of your being,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.380
and it has in the past overshadowed to a great extent

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.380
the other parts of your being,

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.380
which we would like to be brought into harmony with.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.380
We're speaking particularly of the quality of heart.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.380
Your heart, sir, is not trusting.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.380
Do you understand me?

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.380
I do.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.380
Alright, now, um, you've been given a woman who loves you.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.380
Now, she is not a very clear vehicle of this love at times because it's her own fear.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:52.380
Um, but it's interesting that the two of you would have found each other, uh, because you both are of untrusting hearts.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.380
And so, what you were called on to do is to both of you in your own way,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.180
way overcome this untrusting heart and give yourself as totally as you can to each other

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:10.820
in love because it is through this closeness that the two of you have that you will begin

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:19.460
to trust into that movement that is within you so strongly.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.500
I would like to touch with your permission on the situation of your job.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
I'm very interested in that.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.500
There is a jeopardy there for you.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:38.500
Now we're not speaking in terms of your life.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500
Your life is not in jeopardy at all.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.500
There will not be, if there is any disharmony,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.500
it will not be a part of your karmic burden.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.020
There may be such things happening when you're there, they may not be, but that is not the point.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:05.260
The jeopardy that we speak of, it has to do with you in your development as a child of God.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:25.980
The destiny that is held for you is far vaster than what you are allowing yourself to manifest.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:35.980
You have had in your younger years a very deep feeling of your own special destiny. Is this true?

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.980
This is true.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:42.980
But we would venture to say that you have somehow moved away from this.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.980
This is also true.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:59.980
Now, we would ask you to somehow use all of the faculties of incredible minds and beautiful hearts to come together and find your place.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.980
Your place is very helpful where you are now.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:12.980
Please understand that if one were to talk in terms of credit in the karmic sense, you

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980
understand?

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.980
I do.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.980
You are, shall we say, accumulating a great many credits.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:28.980
And that's all for the good, because as you know, all of us in this room have certain

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.020
And so this is all for good.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:40.020
But what we really have in mind for you is something far different from what you're doing.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:46.080
It is not chance that you have married the woman that you're married to, because between

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:54.480
the two of you, you have a very great combination of abilities that can together help a great

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480
many people.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.120
Now, neither of you have found this to be true yet.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.920
you haven't found your mutual niche.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:06.620
If I may use the example of the other two people seated in the room with you tonight,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.620
they have found their karmic togetherness, you see,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.620
and have worked in harmony as a pair,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.920
and have, because of that doubling of their abilities,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.420
brought a great many things to fruition that alone each of them could never have achieved.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.420
Now the same kind of destiny is possible for you and your wife.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.420
It has not manifested at all at this stage of your relationship.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:43.420
And it is, if I may be frank, it is because of both of your doubting hearts.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.420
It is interesting for us on the other side of the light to observe within each of you

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.420
the tremendous love that each of you hold each for the other.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.420
and yet the tremendous reluctance that each of you have for sharing this.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.420
Do you understand me?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.420
I certainly do.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.420
So, begin there if you would please, and have the woman listen to this tape,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.420
and maybe she'll wake up a little, because she's equally at fault here.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:18.420
She has protected her tender heart, because she has suffered, as you know, in this time.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:35.420
And she's tried very hard to learn from this, but part of the side effect of the sadness that she has suffered at the hands of the other incident is that she wants to protect herself from any further pain.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:45.420
She knows that this is not a valid way to live her life and I am very confident, very confident indeed, that she will not continue with this much longer.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:52.820
She is moving into a new area of awareness and we would ask your help in this.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:18:00.180
She will move into a deeper area of spiritual awareness than she ever has before and she

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:08.020
will be afraid and she will be afraid because she will be in, she feels she will be in jeopardy

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.880
of losing her deep relationship with you.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:23.680
She wants very much to serve you, but she must quit trying to serve you as a person and begin

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:32.280
to serve you as a part of the God force, which is a very different thing.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.160
I keep asking this because I need to understand.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.000
Am I making myself clear?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.480
You certainly are.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.480
All right.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:52.180
When this comes upon her, it will be extremely helpful for you to be supportive of her in any way that you can.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:19:02.180
And your heart will be attuned to know what it is that she needs, and we feel sure that she will be able to respond in kind.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:12.180
Together you must find your dual destiny because you were placed together for a very specific reason.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:24.180
And we would be very grateful for our side of things if you would find your way together to fulfill it because it is important.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:31.180
You will both play an important part in things if you will allow yourself to do so.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:37.180
You will not stay in the same type of work that you're in for very much longer.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:45.180
Because as you become more and more attuned to what is going on within your deepest self,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.180
other doors will open.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.180
It is not necessary for us at this time to tell you anything,

00:19:51.180 --> 00:20:00.180
because one of the things that we want from you is to have your own inward-looking process

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:07.980
develop to such a high tone that you will not need this kind of assistance.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.980
Do you see?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.980
I really see it.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.500
And you have tremendous capabilities, tremendous capabilities along this line, far more than

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.860
she does.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:27.900
You have the intuitive quality to be able to discern movement in the destiny.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.900
If you reflect back on your life with her, you will realize that it is often you who says,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.980
"I feel so and so" will happen.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:43.340
And indeed, if you've kept any record at all, you'll see that this is proven to be true.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.780
Now her talents lie in a different area.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.500
Her talents are much more in the heart quality, as you know.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.060
Your mind is more brilliant than hers is, and she knows this, and she finds no quarrel

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.060
with it.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:02.060
we would ask that you would have no quarrel with her ability, which is a flowering of the heart.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:14.060
Because you see, together you will then be able to manifest the two qualities that are so much needed in the next years of this planet.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:22.620
Bartholomew, in the future, would it be permissible for us to check back with you to see whether

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.460
we indeed are pursuing the right path?

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:33.620
Are we in tune with the course and the plan for us?

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.420
I would be pleased to do that.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:43.620
But I must also say again that the two of you joined together in power would be able to do

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:49.300
what is being done now with much more clarity, you see.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.460
And when I say "join together," I mean actually in the beginning a literal joining together,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:22:04.340
say, of the hands in a mutual prayer or sitting side by side in mutual meditation after.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:11.740
We must touch on this, and we do hope that you will take it in all good humor.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:22.540
you think you could do this? I'm more than well. You have in the past reached deep states

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:30.940
of awareness through meditation and indeed deep states through not very serious meditation

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:39.580
is this true? This is true. Now the question then is why have you been like that? I guess

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.580
I have been distrustful.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:51.420
That, I think, is a very true statement of the quality of the situation.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.580
Be aware that you are capable of doing and can do and must do whatever it is you wish

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.580
to do.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:03.580
At least, there is no coercion here at all.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:14.580
But we would ask, on behalf of the light that we all serve, that you reconsider your position.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:22.580
You have a quality that very few humans have, sir, and you will not be doing it.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.580
Would you care to elaborate?

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.580
you have an attunement

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.780
with the higher forces that is almost a natural one

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.980
and you tune into that force with relative ease

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.580
so that it is hard for you to understand the struggles that other people go through

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.580
because it is such an easy thing for you

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.480
but

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:53.580
you will not be able to hear the voice that you seek to hear

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.580
without some kind of deep centering.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:04.980
And the best way of deep centering is to have a decided time

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.380
for a meditative situation. It doesn't matter in your case how long it is, really.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.780
Because, you see, you have a tremendous power of concentration.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:20.780
It is a very compact concentration. That is part, a side effect of a brilliant mind.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.380
a tremendous ability to concentrate, to give oneself totally.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.380
This is something that your wife lacks, and this is her tremendous struggle.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:34.980
Now, this is a tremendous ease for you, and you find no problem with it, but you don't use it.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.980
It's rather ludicrous in a sense. She's struggling so hard for it, and you have it with such ease.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:46.980
But, um, in a sense, she's doing better in this than you are, you know?

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.980
because she's trying harder at this stage of her life, you see.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.980
And you have sort of given up on it, in a way,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.980
and you go to words and you go to readings, and all of this is fine.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.980
And we encourage, in fact, your new trend, your new movement,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:14.980
with this new group that you were congregating an affiliation with, this church.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:22.580
This is to be encouraged in you and all of the readings and so forth that go with it,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.780
this is to be encouraged because there is nothing there, believe me sir, there is nothing there

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.260
that you will learn that you don't know, you see, because you have all of this data recorded

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.260
within you from lifetime.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.260
I mean, you have lived some of that data.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.300
Some of that drama has been your experience.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:45.260
But what it will serve to do is to motivate, to reactivate those things within you that

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.780
you have allowed to go fallow.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:57.420
And you know, and this I speak to all of you in this room, when you seek to keep a body

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:04.140
form, you will be accountable for what you have used, you know?

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:11.140
all been given, the four of you in this room have been given an incredible amount of talent

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:21.140
in the spiritual world. And when the day comes that you stand there, you will be called to

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:32.140
reckon. You will be asked, "Have you used it? Have you really used it?" So, in your

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:41.140
In your case, you've been given a tremendous amount and we're counting on you to use it.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.140
Other people see this in you.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:58.140
Spiritual leaders of various strains have responded to you and understood you and wanted you to become a part of their process because they have understood it.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
But you've only gone so far and then you seem to hold on.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.140
Is this statement of his true?

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.140
It's very true.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.140
We would ask that you reconsider this position.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.140
You would be able to help so many more people on such a vast system.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:25.140
You see, the things that are in line for you are much vaster than you really believe.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.140
I'm speaking of really vast work.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.140
Really vast work.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:39.140
And we've given you the woman who can help you.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:45.140
And we ask both of you to get on with it, you know.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.140
Because there's a lot to be done, and it's not being done.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:58.380
And the way to begin is to begin to ask yourself deeply each day, "What is my way?

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.380
Show me a way.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.380
Teach me."

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.740
Learn, sir, to be taught, if you would.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:10.900
You know, you're a great teacher, but the greatest sign of a great teacher is what kind

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.900
of a student you are.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:18.540
If you can become as great a student as you are a teacher, you will easily fulfill the

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:24.540
function that we have. Do you have any other questions?

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:33.540
Well, you know Bartholomew, you have anticipated all of the questions on my list already. I

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:40.380
do have a small question and I think that you have in a way answered it already, but I wonder

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:47.460
if you could say something about the purpose that was served in my contracting this disease,

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.460
which obviously was planned.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:29:03.460
Well, first, first of all, we would like to say that given a very deep and difficult trial,

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.460
You have arisen, I promise.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.460
Now we just continue.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:16.460
You have gained in the last three weeks

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.460
more wisdom than you have in the last three years.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:27.460
You have come again into harmony.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.460
You have left the harmony, you know, quite a few years now.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:42.460
And in the last few weeks you have re-entered that role of one of the carriers of the light.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:50.460
The experiences that you have had to go through were brutal in many ways.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:58.460
But they're... it was the only thing that you could think of to do.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:07.460
It was startling. It was to startle the total being so that you would remember.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:17.460
It is sort of an imagery perhaps would be being thrown into an icy lake, you see?

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.460
Yes.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:28.460
The awakening has to be that sudden because something that all of you on the Earth plane tend to forget

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.740
is that there are things to be done

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.500
that there is much to be done

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.940
and there is a lot of help needed and often time

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.380
and please understand it was with your full agreement that this was done

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.780
it was with your full agreement that

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.060
the plunge into the lake was taken. You see

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.940
you exist on various levels and

00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:00.440
The level on which your mind is now, for example, all of you in this room, that is one level of existence.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.940
And it is valid in its own way, with its own rules, its own rituals, its own lives.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.440
But, as you are all aware, there are much higher areas.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.940
Now, you move, especially in the sleep state, you move to other areas.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:25.140
It is in your movement, in these other areas, of time, and then out of time, that this was contracted,

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:33.060
between you and those, those guides that worked with you.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.140
And it was discussed, just as we are discussing now.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.860
And the decision was made that this would be undertaken.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.860
The outcome was never really crucial.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.860
There was never any real question that you would die.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.860
But the question had to be raised.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.860
What is life for?

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:59.860
It is only in times of extreme crisis that the questions come to the mind.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.860
What is life for?

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.860
What is my life for?

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.860
Why am I here?

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.860
And so it was agreed.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.860
And so it was.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.860
Now, your teacher is different from your wife's teacher.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.860
By that I mean, I am not your teacher.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.860
I love you.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.860
But, your contact is different from hers.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.860
And this is good.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.860
This is very good.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:41.860
Because you see, your teacher has a whole different awareness that vibrates perfectly with your awareness,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:51.860
just as mine vibrates perfectly with hers, and therefore is best able to help you.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:33:00.860
Your guide is so close to you that you'll be at peace.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.860
And he waits, and he waits, and he waits.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:13.860
So, we would ask you to please reconsider your life goals.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:26.860
If you dedicate your heart and your mind to a divine union with the power that moves through you constantly.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.860
If you will do that, sir, we will take care of the rest of it.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.860
You know, you're a very conscientious man and much to be admired, you know?

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.860
But we'll take care of those things if you'll only allow me to.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:46.860
I am speaking of mortgages, payments, education, colleges, dental bills.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.860
Do you follow me?

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.860
I do.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.860
We'll take care of those things for you.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:59.700
But we cannot begin to move as a dynamic force in your life and begin these changes until

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.500
you totally dedicate yourself to it.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.980
Because once you do that, you will be for all intents and purposes lost to this world in

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980
one sense.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.940
This is why we've given you the wife that we have, because she is one of the women who

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.940
will go along with this.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.140
You know, she's not afraid of poverty.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.460
She's not afraid of not having things.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.220
She's not afraid of a lot of things.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:30.500
The one thing she's afraid of is losing the love.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.420
Now, there are not many people who are like that, you know.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:46.220
There are many people who care a great deal for not having poverty, for having the finest.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:53.500
But she was carefully selected because she will be able to go along with anything that

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.500
comes along.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:06.460
So, please give her the respect that it deserves and know that she works as a part of our plan

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.460
with you.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:14.860
You and each other, in the holiest sense, you see, you and each other, you both have tremendous

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.860
strength.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.260
They're different, but they are not opposite.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.860
They are not in competition.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.860
They are complementary.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.860
So, what would you do?

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.860
Would you give thought to this?

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860
I certainly would.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:42.860
And see if out of this experience of a new baptism, you know, the word "baptism" is extremely

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:49.860
extremely important and especially in your life. It would be great fun for you to someday

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:57.780
be able to play back the life of baptisms that you've gone through, physical, the various

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:06.700
baptisms in various bodies of waters and so forth. Is there something wrong? Can I?

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.700
No, I'm just checking.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.540
And this last experience that you've had with your illness is a new baptism.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.540
Have you felt that at all?

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.540
Yes, I have.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.540
Fine.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.540
Because that is what we hope.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:24.540
That it is a total cleansing, even to the point of your whole physical being.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:33.460
You see, it's a cleanness, it's a newness, it's a new skin, a new skin for a new one

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.900
to be placed in.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.900
I think that symbology will be meaningful to you.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.900
It is meaningful.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:49.780
So, in the name of the light, and in the name of the Christ, which we both serve, we would

00:36:49.780 --> 00:37:00.180
ask that you reconsider in the next two months your deepest yearnings and see if you can

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:07.180
and become one with the knowledge that your guide is waiting to present to you.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.180
Have I contacted my guide before now?

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.180
Oh yes. Oh yes you have.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:22.180
But you see, your guide stands so close to the prize.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:32.180
You know, life comes in all shapes and forms, sizes, vibrations.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.180
But yours can, so too.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.180
But you must...

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.180
You must be in a...

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.180
How can I speak this?

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:57.180
You must be in a relatively pure state to be able to hear it.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.180
Do you understand?

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.180
I do.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.180
There are many people that can meet guides, all kinds of guides.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:15.180
But the purity of the person calls forth the purity of the guide.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:26.860
And in your case, if you could work toward a greater purification, whatever that means

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.260
to you, we will not spell it out because it is part of your learning process to find out

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.140
what things are pure for you and what things are not.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:41.060
But as you move toward that, it will be a dual movement.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.460
you become more purified, you will be able then to receive so much more.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:52.540
You know, this is the reason for all of these tremendous rituals and purification rites

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:58.260
and in the deep Indian tradition, all of the renunciations and so forth.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.660
I'm speaking now to all of you in the room.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:09.260
This is because it is true that the degree to which the body and mind are in a pure state,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:14.940
reflect a pure light vibration. I'm sure you're all aware of this. But this is the reason

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:22.200
for it. It's nothing mysterious. The more pure your mind, the more absorbed your mind,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.200
in your case, sir, was the word, if you follow that.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
I do.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.980
The more you are absorbed in the word, the purer you will become. It will be almost an

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.580
automatic thing. We do not suggest that you run home and begin a great program of rigorous

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:48.340
self-discipline, that would be superfluous. As you become one with the word, it will be

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:56.140
almost as if the purification is done for you. I think you have already sensed a great

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.140
deal of this in the last few weeks. Is that true?

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.580
It's already begun to happen. Right, and this is why we speak to it. Allow

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.580
Allow this to continue to happen, will you?

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.580
I will.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:12.060
Don't put such restrictions on yourself that you become rigid and antagonistic, you see.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.060
Allow yourself the flow of wine, for example.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.980
Wine is a lovely thing.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.620
Properly used wine is a lovely thing.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.660
And your beloved Christ, He tries it, you know.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:32.060
Problem is, don't become so rigid in your discipline that spontaneity goes out of your

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:41.060
Your life will purify on its own as long as you continue to submerge yourself in the Word.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.060
So don't worry about it.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.060
But once again, we would like to say two things to you.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:41:02.700
One, you have vastly underestimated your abilities and your role as a child of the light in this

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:16.700
Recall back to your early years and try and remember the stamp that was given so long

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.700
ago on your lap.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:31.700
And we ask a second, if you do your utmost, to use the gift that you have been given,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:37.700
because there is feeling, I think all of us have feeling, there is feeling.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:45.700
You have no idea of that of what is after you, of you.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:56.940
But now through meditation and with meditating on my guide I will begin to learn more specifically

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.060
what is expected of me.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.060
Is this correct?

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:11.500
Once you turn your mind and heart over to Christ, your life will totally change and you will

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.300
only have to move through it.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.740
You will have to make very little effort.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:22.740
You think the emphasis must be on merging with the Word.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.740
All else will follow. All else.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:34.740
It will be as if out of nowhere someone approaches you and asks if you will undertake something.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:41.740
And you will do it. I mean you will know, intuitively, that it moves in harmony with the Word.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:48.740
If I were speaking to this person I would say that it moves in harmony with the Tao.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.740
This is a meaningful phrase for you.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.740
This is the word for you.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.740
You see?

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.740
And it is such a simple thing.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:00.740
It one turns one's entire mind and heart over to the word.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.740
Which you can do.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.740
And immerse yourself in that.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.740
In the first place you will move into joy.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.740
Now joy has been a stranger to you for a long time, hasn't it?

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.740
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:21.740
And this does not need to be because actually you were created as one of the joyful ones of God.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.740
And as a child, you know, you were.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.740
If you will think back on the early years, you were a sun in the sky.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.740
There was sun and joy.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.740
And then life began to take its toll and you lost it.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.740
Now's the time to move back into the sun.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.740
You know, you also carry the sign of the sun.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.740
And that's important.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.740
That's an area for me.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.740
Well, the sun in you

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.740
is that each person has a different sign.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.740
Not astrologically speaking. No.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.740
No, no. Astrologically speaking,

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.740
quite frankly, much of the astrology

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:19.380
Much of the astrology is grossly misinterpreted and twisted and I would not put a great deal

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.980
of faith in it.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:31.540
No, I'm speaking of, it's almost as if various people have stamps upon their being and with

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:40.300
With you it's the stamp of the sun, and it is also the stamp of the Son of God, in a

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.220
very meaningful Christian sense.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:54.380
So you will have all things of this union, but unfortunately, it's the only thing about

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.220
when you give up all things and bring your Lord.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:06.220
And once you've done this, your path will be so obvious that you will shake your head

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.220
and wonder if you didn't understand it before.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.220
You know?

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.220
It will seem, "How did I get here?"

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:18.220
Seven years later.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.220
Yes, I have no questions.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.220
May the Holy Spirit bless you.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:34.660
I wonder if you could speak a little bit about my wife and my relationship with a man who

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:45.060
was our teacher or served in capacity life vats for a number of years in Taos, New Mexico

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.180
and his name is Herman Rednick.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:55.740
And we have wondered for some time now whether it was right for us to leave him and what

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.260
our relationship is with him.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:06.180
Well, first of all, you are absolutely right, Lisa.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:12.660
You see, now for the great majority of this gentleman's following, it is right that they

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.780
stay with him.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:22.780
But once again, without seeming to, what do you want to say, give undue praise to you,

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:30.280
I must say again that you and your wife carry a different destiny than many people.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:38.780
And the destiny that you two will be asked to carry out is vaster than that which you

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.780
see, because it will be based on a different level of vibration.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.540
He is a beautiful son of God, a beautiful son of God.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:53.940
In fact, it must be stated, and this will come as a surprise to many people, he stands

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:59.660
closer to the light than does your other teacher, Swami Jyoti.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:06.740
The reason being that Mr. Rednick has a great deal of humility, and it is through humility

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.580
that one comes to know God.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:16.900
although much of what he presents can be easily and is easily garbled or has been in the past,

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:25.620
his heart is in a very pure state. Much of it is garbled, much of it is garbled, but

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:34.020
the strain, the field, the force field through which he moves and which manifests through him

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.020
it was very true and very high-stakes.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:40.020
The problem is it gets garbled in the translation.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.020
Now, this is no longer as true as it was in the past.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:54.020
And I believe that you should have no feelings of doubt

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.020
or any other such feelings about leaving me.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:02.020
It was part of our movement in your life to remove you.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:08.020
You know, it was a chance that we moved you out of that situation.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.020
If it had been best for you, you'd still be there.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.020
You know, it would be true.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.020
So, please trust us, my little son.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:25.020
Please trust that we know what is best for your destiny.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:34.020
For example, the latest meeting you've had with the leader of this church group?

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.020
Yes.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.020
This man will be important to you.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.020
More so to you than to your wife.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.020
But he will be important to you.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.020
That's really all we need to say at this time.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:54.020
But also, again, please do not be in dismay when you find yourself moving out of that situation.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:49:01.020
Certain things are needed at certain times and one needs to participate fully in that

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:12.020
moment and this is a very special and wonderful time and it will come as a surprise to you

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:20.020
but in a few months you may be finding that you and your wife are teaching him things

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.020
that he needs to know.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.020
You see?

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:28.020
It is a reciprocal agreement to have made

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.020
to come to a greater understanding.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.020
Do you see?

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.020
There's something on both sides.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.020
There are certain things that he needs to know

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.020
that you know.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.020
And there are certain things that you need to know that he knows.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.020
So there will be an exchange.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.020
But please don't be overly concerned.

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:54.020
May I ask another question?

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.020
Sure.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.020
Of perhaps a more theoretical nature,

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.020
if I have observed,

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:07.020
through the various experiences that have occurred to me,

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.020
and this recent one with Bachel from being an example,

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.020
that the major events of my life,

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.020
major things that have happened to me, for example,

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.020
my marriage with Mary Margaret,

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.020
the several occupations I've had,

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.020
my interest in philosophy and whatnot,

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:33.020
the child that was born to us and the other children,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.020
these things do not seem to be my doing,

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:42.020
and they don't seem to be matters in which I ultimately have to very much

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:49.020
Although on a more mundane level, I can see that I made certain choices and there were

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:53.540
certain results, I really have the impression that I don't have much control over what happens

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.540
to me.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.540
Well, of course you don't.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.540
And just be grateful that you don't.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:09.540
Left to our own devices on the earth's plane, as I remember so well from my experience on

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.540
so well from my experience that I would say,

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.540
that left to our own devices on the earth's planet,

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:19.540
things would be chaotic indeed if we were allowed to manifest

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.540
all of our various and sensuous desires.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:28.540
Can you imagine a universe founded on that basis?

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.540
You would not wish, you would not wish to live there.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.540
You would not.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:40.540
Now, I would like to say one thing, however, that might not be correct.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.540
One moment, please.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.540
I would like to try to get in touch with your guy.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:55.540
I'm not sure the vehicle of the woman can do it. We will have to try.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:59.540
Justin.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.540
Yes, ma'am.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.540
It's been a long time.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.540
Indeed.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.540
Have you not missed me?

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:15.540
I have longed for you greatly.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.540
Then why have you not come?

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:28.540
It's my own doubt and fear that has prevented it.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.540
Listen.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:49.540
Listen well. It is my service to you that those who come to me will be relieved of doubt and

00:52:49.540 --> 00:53:00.140
fear. There is nothing upon the earth plane that will be able to ever remove your doubt

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:07.140
If you wish peace, joy, light and wisdom, there is but one place that you can come to.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:24.820
I have taught you this in past times. I come to remind you again. I am in you.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:37.420
Master, can you give me specific instructions as to what you would want me to do at this time in my life?

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:45.420
You have abandoned all connection.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:51.420
You have ceased to strengthen it.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:59.420
If you seek to strengthen it, it is as if it does not exist.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:12.420
We will build a connection again through two ways.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:26.420
You must begin an organized, deliberate time of meeting with me.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:31.420
I will be there. Will you be there?

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.420
I will be there.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:46.420
Second, you must learn to listen to yourself.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:54.420
It was said earlier this evening, I will say again.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:55:02.420
You listen to others, to others.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:09.420
Your way is your way.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:20.420
Created between us before Earth life began.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:28.420
There is much to be done and I am waiting.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.420
is

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:40.420
that

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:50.420
Master, is there any particular meditation that you're wishing to use?

00:55:50.420 --> 00:56:00.420
You have, in your lifetime, many, many times

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:13.420
[?]

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.420
Embrace the cross.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:32.420
[?]

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:39.420
It is through your surrender to the cross as you perceive it.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:51.420
If you are being in time of doubt, throw yourself at the foot of the cross.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.420
It has not failed you.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.420
It will.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:16.420
The Christ that you know and understand has a plan for you.

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:28.420
Please, recall the plans that we made before coming.

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:38.420
Please, respond to what you know to be a blessing.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:43.420
Go to the cross and it will always be a blessing.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:49.420
If we lay back, we surrender, and we are quiet.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:53.420
We're not there yet.

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.420
Yes.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:22.420
Are there any other questions?

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.420
No.

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.420
I have to go. I have to go tomorrow.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.420
It's beautiful.

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.420
It's time.

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.420
The last one is Friday, I think.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.420
Yes.

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.420
So, so, are you finished?

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.420
We have to go.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.420
Thank you, Bhagwan.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:47.420
Good afternoon.

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.420
Good afternoon, Bhagwan.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.420
Have you thought of anything?

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:56.420
Yes.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:07.420
First, I would like to ask for some insight on your success in your relationship with Shri Shantananda Alex.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:19.420
So this is a relationship in the terminology of the world that has come home to me.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.420
I believe that's what the term is.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:28.420
Namaste. This is an old, an old relationship.

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:34.420
More in relationship to your wife really than anything else.

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:40.420
But nevertheless, interesting and touch for you.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:46.420
I believe I will address most of this to your wife, since she does seem to be the focal point of this.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:50.420
If you don't mind, this is for me.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:55.420
The first thing that I would really like to tell you is that,

00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:01.420
although the circumstances may seem difficult for you on the physical plane,

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:05.420
There is a gap here of tremendous importance.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:13.420
Your connection with her is old, has not been very important in this lifetime at all,

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.420
but nevertheless carries a very strong impression from two lifetimes ago.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:25.420
This is a carryover, of course, that is stated out of your consciousness and also out of hers.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:35.220
The reason that she is here in this particular relationship is to enable me to repay this

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:42.420
project that has been left over.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:49.820
The main thing is to remember that it will not be of a very long-lasting nature.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:54.820
you will not be in relationship to you in this way for very much longer.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.940
But make good use of it if you would while she's here because there are some important

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:01.940
lessons.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:08.540
First of all, the most important thing that we would ask you to remember is that there

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.460
is nothing you can do for her.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:21.760
This is because of your awareness of freedom that can exist on the earth plane within one's mind.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:30.660
If one's mind has light in it, you feel that you would like in some way transfer this wisdom to her so that she may help her.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:39.860
One hates to give up on anyone, but please rest assured that experts have tried in this field and have failed.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:48.360
She has been given many, many opportunities to lighten her load, literally to lighten it, to bring light to herself, to her load.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:57.360
She has within her conscious memory in this lifetime many, many references of various religions and textbooks

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:04.860
that would, if she would become deeply concentrated on it, would tremendously lighten her life.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.360
But each time she has chosen to remain as she is.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:15.360
So please, first and foremost, do not feel at all responsible for transforming any of this, please.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
Alright?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:22.360
And don't even make a terribly great effort to incorporate her into your group

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.360
or to make any special efforts along that line.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.360
In a sense, we are dealing with a spoiled child.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:38.360
He has for many years been allowed to be spoiled and continues it in its later advanced years.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.360
But don't be overly concerned.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:51.360
And when you're there, my concern mostly is that she will try to somehow bleed from you.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.360
This is a term that we use. I don't know how it translates to for you.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:02.800
A bleeding of an energy field from one person to another is a very common thing on the Earth

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.800
plane that is not always observed by the human.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.600
Meaning that she would gain energy from you?

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600
Exactly.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
Yeah.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600
Now this takes many forms.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:22.000
It's not just a matter of as you sit there that she would somehow remove it from you.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.440
It usually will come in the terms of wanting you to do extra extraneous things for her.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:34.560
In other words, you using your energy for her rather than for her being herself.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.480
Now many things that other people can perform for this woman she could do for herself.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:46.120
And it is a way of her becoming center stage.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.280
And that's all a very childish response to this situation.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.120
And really, if you can get it out of your mind, if you're dealing with an adult, I think you

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.120
would do better.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.440
Just look on her with the tenderhearted concern as you would of a child who has not yet reached

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440
the state of maturity.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.880
It's not a premature case, but she will pass over and will still be in this state and then

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.040
will have much to do with that if it's not your concern.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:21.640
So our worry is do not allow her to misuse your energy and your time

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.740
because it is not as if you were helping her to be more positive.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:33.440
Do what you feel is vital and is loving and is necessary,

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.940
but please be well aware that there is a childish resentment in her

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:44.780
against any field of love for anyone else that you may have.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.940
And this includes your husband.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:52.780
He resents the times and the tides that you have built up with him.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:56.780
He will resent very much knowing, for example, when your family is issuing,

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.220
"This will be another time that you will have difficulties."

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:04.820
These times will, you know, repeat themselves with anyone who is close to you.

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:10.180
But just as you would not indulge a child, as you would just be firm and loving,

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:15.380
we would request that you consider this approach to her.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.420
One, you cannot really help her.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:22.660
So please don't make overly conscientious efforts along that line.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.740
And two, really stand and move.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.740
There is on the Earth planet this time a lot of children

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:36.740
A lot of children

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.740
who are called

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.740
I cannot remember the term

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.740
I'm sorry

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:44.740
It was a

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.740
The way the students were asked was they were overly active

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.740
next to

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.740
tension, what do you mean?

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.740
Hyperactive children

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.740
Yes

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740
Now

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.940
And there are many more of them on the earth plane at this time than there ever have been.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.940
And this is an interesting question that no one seems to have asked yet, as to why.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.540
Well, this woman should be considered for an abuse.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.740
She will make excessive demands, she will be very arbitrary,

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:14.040
she will be very full of tempers and intentions, in a sense.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:20.140
And just treat it as you would one of these children.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.540
Abby, anything else?

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.540
Yes, just one more question.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.540
You mentioned that I had a debt that I owe to her.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.540
Is there anything else that I owe her?

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:39.540
Or anything else that I need to do for her, even though I can't help her with her understanding?

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.540
Is there any other debt here that I owe her?

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:47.540
Well, it is a small matter in terms of, in the two last times that I spoke of,

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.100
that there was an opportunity when you were less developed two lifetime ago.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:57.060
You have done a great deal in your two lifetime.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.540
And two lifetime ago, there was an opportunity

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.540
for you to help her in a physical manner, on a physical plane,

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.740
simply in a physical way.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.260
And you turned on her and did it.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:13.220
And it's simple that. It's nothing terribly complicated or terribly...

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.660
It's certainly nothing other than that.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:23.660
We have the opportunity, we have the opportunity, we have the presidency set out at this time

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.660
and to end your responsibility and to execute your responsibility and to stop all of this

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:28.660
going on.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.660
I just want to make the point, just the fact that I really, really, really, really, really

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:36.660
second and third if he's alright, that if he has to leave, he has to leave.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660
So that's better?

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.660
Take care of it, that's better.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.660
Okay, thank you so much.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:46.660
There's no need for any concern.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:56.660
The moment she really wants help, there is so much crowding within her home that is waiting to assist her.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.660
So we simply wait for her.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.660
We have been continuing to study the polynomial power of four groups,

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.660
and some of those have been developed in our subjects for a period of time.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:25.660
Going into some of these groups, there are two that are left possibly in the subject,

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:33.660
and this is a subject I would like to suggest that you might have for the function of this group,

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:39.660
and perhaps to individuals, it might be the benefit to most.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.660
Well, I think it's a wonderful idea.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.660
And I'm so glad you picked it up.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:51.660
Because it is something that we have been suggesting in various ways to you for quite a while.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:59.660
And we're very pleased that you've received this message.

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.660
Because this is indeed what is needed because your group has been at the level

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.660
and there are those who are very much ready for a new figure.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.660
Now, there is one problem you have not fixed.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.660
The one to do not...

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:20.660
The problem that you will face is how to get a core group to function

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:25.660
without making the others feel in any way left out.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:39.700
Now, I think that one of the ways to avoid this obvious problem is if you announce that

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:51.180
you are going to start a very serious strategy and that it will involve a degree of commitment,

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.180
But certain ones of them will eliminate themselves automatically.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.180
You understand what I mean?

01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.180
But some of them will say, "Well, obviously I don't have the time, I don't have the interest," and so forth.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.180
But there is an internal need.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.180
But then there will be others who will be drawn,

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.180
who will not really be as committed as they think they are,

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:13.180
but for a social reason or for their own ego or for whatever reason,

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.180
will then be drawn to come in.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.180
I would not be overly concerned about them,

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.180
because one of two things will happen.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:26.180
They will either become very serious, which is of course what you would hope for, but

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:31.180
through the deeper studying that they are into, this will then bring forward the very thing

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.180
that you're trying for.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:39.180
Or they will find themselves either bored or can't find the time or will leave themselves

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.180
out of the situation.

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.180
Don't be overly concerned, but I think your presentation must be very strong, that this

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:51.540
that this is a disciplined order. You see, there will be a set

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:59.140
path even, so much of the beginning path. You see what I'm saying? It must be structured

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:07.300
in a very disciplined manner. There should be required times of medication for them,

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:15.220
whatever you choose to set up. But there must be a commitment on their part prior to joining it.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.220
if you could present it as sort of an experiment, if you will.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.220
You know, if you would like to experiment on whether certain things are beneficial or not

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.220
and you would like a certain core group to work with you.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:33.220
Now, if everyone in your group volunteers, then you will have a difficult problem

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.220
and you may have to drop the charges. Do you see?

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:43.220
If the knife that you announced, if they all say, "Fine, let us turn this knife into that serious study,"

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.220
Then you will have to think about that.

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.220
Then you may have to impose those rules right then

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.220
and say that this is a requirement

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.220
and that of course anyone who comes on that particular night

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.220
will have to fulfill these requirements.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.220
Do you see?

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.220
No, we're making it an afternoon meeting for that reason, partner.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.220
My point is this.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.220
If on your night of your meeting you announce this,

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:13.220
Everyone will say, "Well, that's why we're here.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:17.220
That's why we're sitting here. That's just what we want."

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.220
Now this will then give you pause.

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:29.220
And you may then have to say, "Alright, then let us turn this into a definite group meeting with definite structures."

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:35.220
You see, the rules that were applied to your afternoon meeting will now have to be applied to your evening meeting.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.220
And then you'll have to see how it works out.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:50.740
You may get a lot of the people that come in the evening will simply not come anymore because

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:56.540
it's too intense, they don't get to talk enough, they have to do too much meditation, things

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.300
are too deep or you see they will weep and tell jokes.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.700
So many things can happen.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:10.060
I think you would do best if you would keep an open mind and as you see here Mr. Sage,

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:19.260
we would like to have a very serious core group that will go into deeper areas of these subjects

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:25.420
field and I would appreciate it if those of you who are interested will contact me at a

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:26.420
later time.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:33.420
Because this then removes that spontaneous combustion of everyone saying, "Oh, no, no,

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.180
I want it, you think, please contact me at a later time."

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:43.100
That in itself will weed out a lot of the people who will not take the time to telephone, to

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.780
set up an appointment to come and see you.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:51.660
And I think that you should both be very serious about that sort of meeting when they come,

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.660
each one comes on their own to you.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:59.160
To really work with them as to whether it is something they really want.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.660
In other words, to have a certain standard that you would set.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.660
And then ask them if this is really what they're looking for.

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:10.660
Sort of like you have an opening in a job.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:19.660
You know, you have to present your desires and what you want in the group

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:24.620
and see if that person who is sitting there will be able to fulfill that or who even wants to.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:32.460
You must be sober about it is my meaning. Otherwise you are going to have the same pattern repeating

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:37.180
only your afternoon group will be filled with people who don't work and who don't want to go

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:46.060
to the supermarket you see. So much of it depends on your seriousness and please as much as you can

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:51.060
and put aside all preconceived ideas of who should belong, because you may be surprised.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.060
May I ask a question?

01:14:53.060 --> 01:15:03.060
To understand you correctly, that when we announced this meeting, and then when we set a time

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:14.060
that they come, we should have a program laid out, say, if we would work it out between ourselves,

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:33.420
My thought was this, the evening comes and you announce that you are going to, do not

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:41.900
say you are thinking of, just say you are going to start a core group and anyone who is interested

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.300
please contact you by phone

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.140
at a later date

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.780
and you will set up

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.460
with each person individually

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:53.060
any time when they come to your home

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.900
and discuss with you

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.580
whether

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.260
they would really want to participate in this

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.700
you see?

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.900
And then each one will come at a separate time

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.300
Oh, okay

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.300
not having four people come at once

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:04.620
I see

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.620
because you see what you really want is

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.460
first of all the person who cares enough to make the phone call

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:12.300
the person who cares enough to set up the interview,

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.900
the person who cares enough to give thought to what you present.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:20.500
Now, when each one of them individually comes and speaks to you,

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.180
that is when you could say, "This is a rigorous program,

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.780
this is what we have in mind,

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.340
we're going to have these as our certain criteria,

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:32.220
and we really want this to be a much more intense and serious situation."

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.420
Now, many of the egos will respond, "Yes, yes,"

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.980
but in actuality, many of them will probably drop out

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:45.980
because they will not be able to prove themselves about how rigorous they're being.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:55.980
And I think it would be important, very important, that there be a knowledge in them

01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:02.980
that if they do take this on, that they will really give themselves to it for a certain period of time

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.980
as an experimental group.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.780
But again I say you should be serious about this and the reason I say that is that you

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.260
tend to be a little tenuous about things like this.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.980
You see, you are a little tenuous.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.980
And that is not really... that makes them tenuous.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:24.420
Well, if I do the work that's alright, but if I don't well then I feel like... this kind

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.420
of thing.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.980
So if you could be a little more sober about that.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.980
Yes.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:31.980
Thank you.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:55.980
Thank you. The next point that I wanted to ask about, Arnold Kleinbierger, historian, made a statement recently that he saw one of the most important events in this era was the interpenetration of Christianity by Buddhism. Do you have any comments on that?

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:07.980
The movement of the world, the movement of all of the forces on the earth plane is toward a oneness.

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:16.980
The statement that he is making comes from his bias and should be understood as such.

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:25.660
But what is represented in the truth of all that kind of statement is that the aim of

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:30.860
those of us that stand on the other side of the light is to pierce the mind of man with

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:37.700
the knowledge that the energy from which their each varying religion derives its meaning

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.140
comes from one source.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:46.660
And any interpenetration is only successful to the extent that each of those two entities

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.460
come to see their deep similarity of source.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:53.180
It would be a sane statement, a sane truth in a statement to say

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:56.820
that Mohammedanism and Christianity coming together

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.540
would be an important event.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.460
Or the religion of Islam, whatever.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.540
Because what is really the thrust of all of this

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.660
is for all to see that there is one source.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.260
There is one source.

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:16.140
And any movement that can be made on the earth plane for people

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.580
to blend their varying dichotomies together

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.660
into an awareness that there is only one source from which they spring.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.940
That is a very monumental

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:32.900
movement on the part of the human entity.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.960
So,

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:40.180
there's not anything particularly special about Buddhism and Christianity,

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.420
but the only time that it will be at all special is

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.060
if, as a result,

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:50.060
if these two different feelings, these two different strains

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:54.060
can blend together to the point where they recognize

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:59.660
their one basic source from which they spring,

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.860
then it will have been a successful experiment.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.160
It is by no means a completed fact.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.660
By no means.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.160
And in fact, there is jeopardy, because it could set them up,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.760
set many people up in opposition, you see.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:19.480
Any kind of a force like this also creates an opposite force, and some of that opposite force is taking

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:28.760
a great deal of manifestation in the Christian world, where they are becoming, if I may say, bullheaded

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:37.080
about this, you see. They are...it's almost a backlash of isolation.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.920
The Christian movement is becoming perhaps even more isolated, in a sense, a certain strain of it.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:50.520
as a result of what they consider to be that thrust of this Buddhist philosophy.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:56.220
But the basic important thing for all to see, from our perception,

01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:03.120
the basic thing that they need to see, is to drop all of the extraneous things that are not the same.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.120
For example, the enlightened Buddhists or the enlightened Christians will tell you

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.280
that the understanding of Christ and the Buddha are very similar.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.040
They are very similar.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.360
There are certain areas, of course, where they differ because of many obvious things.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.680
But the truth, the heart of both of these,

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.360
be with truth, and this is what is hoped.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.160
This is what is hoped, you see.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.720
Now, it may not be successful.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.280
It may not work.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.920
You implied one time that that was part of my function at this time, was to promote this sort of thing.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920
Yes, this is still true.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:50.920
And the reason that you are helpful in this regard is that you are able to also see the truth that lies in Christianity.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.720
You see, it's not very healthy to have a lot of people biased.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.920
A lot of Christians saying that their way is the only way, and a lot of Buddhists, which they also say,

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920
but their way is the only way.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.920
We observe a very interesting thing.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.920
The Hindu, for example, says

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.920
that he is willing to

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.920
honor other gods and so forth.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.920
But in fact,

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.920
if you wish to take each individual

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.920
Hindu, you see,

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.920
and ask that particular Hindu

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.920
his particular deep belief,

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.920
what he will tell you is

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.920
that his particular deity

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.920
is the strongest. You see, there really is very little...

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:38.920
A Buddhist, for example, is very willing to say, "Yes, Christianity can be accepted," and so forth.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.920
But if you take a particular Buddhist and speak to him clearly, what he says is, "Buddha is the way."

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:55.920
You see what I'm saying? That although the theology of these various religions gives approval of other religions,

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.920
in the heart of the person who is doing the worshipping,

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:03.920
there is a feeling of superiority over other religions.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.920
And this is what we want so much,

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.920
to see breaking down if we can.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.920
And the reason that you will be helpful,

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.920
you will be helpful to the extent that you can see

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.920
the Christ heart beating within the Buddha's heart,

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.920
and realizing that they both beat

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.440
with the same pulse because it is the pulse of God.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:34.400
You see, they tend to forget that it is God that is the source from which all of the Christ

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.240
and the Buddha stream, you see.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:48.240
And the antithesis must go back to the sinner and to the similarities instead of to the dissimilarities.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:24:00.320
Once you made a statement about reincarnation and it seemed to me that you viewed the subject

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:06.480
from a different perspective from the usual one that we have here on this planet.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:12.720
Would you help us with your insight on this process?

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:20.720
Well, incarnation, reincarnation, the whole subject is very muddled.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:32.280
The reason for this is, of course, the ego's tremendous desire to feel that it will live

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.560
on forever.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:42.680
And therefore it tries very hard to keep its life pulse beating throughout eternity.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:49.000
Therefore you have many of the doctrines that say that one life follows another and so forth.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:57.160
What I am going to say will probably not please many of you or maybe any of you.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:11.160
But what is true is that your life as each one of you individually live it is not as

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:19.160
separate from other people's lives as your perception would lend you to think.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:28.160
For example, in the case of you and your wife, you've spent many years together.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:37.160
You must perceive your life as your own entity moving through certain steps, affected by your

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.160
This is a typical view of reincarnation.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:47.720
Now, that is partially true, but it is partially not true, because the fact is that if you

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.920
could perceive with the inner eye rather than just the eyes of the body, you would perceive

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.920
that the body of you and your wife, there is no difference.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:05.280
You see, if you could see this in your mind and could see the perception of the movement,

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.920
the unrelating movement of light that moves between these four bodies,

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.840
you would laugh at this idea of your tremendous separateness,

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.440
because you are not separate.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.560
You see, a thought comes from that gentleman there,

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.560
over this way, and its movement blends with what is happening here and changes it.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.240
There is not this tremendous wall that separates each one,

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.800
and this is why the great teachers have emphasized over and over and over again,

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.800
When you begin the movement toward awareness of the light, of the God Self, of the Christ, of the Buddha, whatever,

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:47.800
when you begin this movement, the reason I ask you to be selective about who you're with

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.800
is because of these very human elements which I'm speaking.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.800
It is not some kind of a prudish, um, specialistic idea.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.600
is simply a truth that you blend

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.800
and the ones that are closest to you in physical form

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.100
are the ones you blend the easiest with.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.100
This makes good sense to you, I hope.

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:11.400
So, therefore, this is why we have a concern about this gentleman

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.800
and his job that he is chosen.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.600
Do you understand me, sir?

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600
I certainly do.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.200
Because he also is not separate

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.800
from all of the movements that are happening out where he is located.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:30.800
And although we have done our best to protect him with a shield of light, there is only

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.800
so much that one can do when a person is placed in that environment.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.800
The reason that he will move out of his location is simply that as he becomes more purified,

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:46.800
as his consciousness becomes more and more attuned, it will be increasingly, instead

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.800
of being easier to be there, it will be more difficult to be there.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.680
because there will be this continual mingling. Do you see what I'm saying?

01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:02.800
That their consciousness, of those entities, is on a lower plane at this time

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:08.160
and is unfortunately kept isolated because that's almost all they have.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.160
And they draw on to them people who they call guards whose consciousness are very similar.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.280
Now, the exceptions are in the teaching staff

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.280
and there is other ten points of light that I perceive now in that building.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280
There are ten points of light.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280
The teaching end of the building has this.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:35.280
But if you understand this room, this is one of the reasons why you may find yourself moving out of that.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.280
Now, back to the reincarnation.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:46.960
It is very, very funny for us to view all of you feeling that your little life is so special

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:52.360
and so separate and so very independent from our perception.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.640
Please be glad that this is not so.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.560
Because if this were true, it would be extremely difficult for you to transcend.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.560
Extremely.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:08.560
Because you see, if you were independent one from another, you would also be independent

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.760
from the source of the good ones, from the source of the great ones that stand there, you see.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:21.760
You cannot be isolated only from other people and not... and also then be open to the vast

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.760
wisdom of the great ones that stand there, you see.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:28.760
So be grateful, please, that it's been set up in this manner.

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.960
It is much more wonderful, if you can get the mind to some extent, so much more wonderful

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:42.040
to realize that as the four of these bodies sit in this room, that what they all are is

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:49.120
this melding and merging and doing in many ways a lesson with them, you see.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.720
And this is why the environment in which you live speaks importantly to you also.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:02.880
You know, if you live in a very dark hovel, there is something within that dark hovel that

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.360
can take upon you and you will become a part of that because you think you are a part of

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.640
this. You are a part of this. You know there is nothing in this environment that you are

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:18.680
not in movement with. From your perception it's a lot of separate things. In reality

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:25.280
it is movement. And so against you, to you I would say that the environment that you

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:34.280
The way the Orient presents this jeopardy, because they are confined into one limited area,

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.280
it makes the power of it stronger and there is less likelihood of it opening up.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.280
Now the one fortunate thing is where it is placed.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:49.280
I see it on a vast mesa, open to the open area of that tree.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:56.280
And this is very helpful because you see there is a movement, a harmony of land and sky and

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:04.080
clouds, wind moves through there and that does help to dissipate a lot of that.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.880
And you force your choice to place these institutions out in such areas and not stay in the heart

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:17.240
of the city where they would be even more impacted with difficult mindsets.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.240
Because the land itself vibrates to help them, you see.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.240
That there is a movement within the land because there is no separation between the sand and

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:29.240
the sky and the sea and the building and the beings.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:33.240
There is this movement, this constant exchange.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.240
Have I made this clear to you?

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240
Yes.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:44.240
This matter, you said that you talked about the self as land.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.740
and then you have two lifetimes of the opposite?

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.740
How does that relationship work?

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:58.660
Now there is always, there is always a focal point in a sense that we would call in this

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.980
case, Louisa Aiken.

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:09.820
Now, Louisa Aiken perceives herself as the same person with various changes leading to

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:10.820
one lifetime.

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:16.700
Now in reality, if she could see herself, she would realize that she is now a tremendous

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:23.100
composite of a great many other people, images, movements, thought forms, and so forth.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:29.600
But there still is a center core around which some of these adhere.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:34.500
Now the most important particles, the most important movements,

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:39.000
coalesce into the strongest particles.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.900
Now I'm not thinking necessarily of the most positive or the most negative.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:49.900
I'm just saying the strongest, it's as if there's a magnet named Lurica

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:55.900
and certain forces are drawn to her and sometimes right through her

01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.900
because there is no responding magnetism of any kind

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:04.900
and they just become unimportant. They do not affect the core of the person.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.900
But on the other hand, certain other things move through her

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:11.900
that have a tremendous correlation that have what you would call a hook-up.

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:19.900
a hookup, it's almost a molecular, it is a light hookup within her of correspondence

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:27.180
of vibration and they stay with her. And so it is this essence that we speak of as Louisa.

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:32.780
To go, to say two lifetimes ago is very helpful for her at this moment in understanding her

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:37.980
situation with this woman. Alright? Now if I were to speak from another perception I would

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:45.980
that there's a residue within this woman, within Luisa, that needs to be dissipated.

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:52.980
It will be dissipated through the giving of light to this manifestation outside herself

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.980
that she sees at this other woman.

01:33:54.980 --> 01:34:01.980
When this is given to her, the thing will be, the molecular tension will be broken and this

01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:05.980
will be just away from her and no longer be a part of her.

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.980
Do you understand me?

01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.980
Would you like a clarification?

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:19.980
Well, I was thinking, I think, I mean, seeing different people that we meet that come through our lives.

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:29.980
And I have noticed this in myself, that some of them, you just automatically feel a great closeness and a love.

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:32.980
And you join in this union of closeness and being with them.

01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:39.980
There are other people, very nice people, very good people, that you don't feel like seeing

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.980
the attraction for.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.980
And I have wondered about that.

01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:45.980
Is that the thing, that they're on a different vibration?

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:46.980
That's true.

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.980
They're not important for what you are a composite of at that moment.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:56.980
For example, someone who in your terminology is not very spiritually evolved, which is the

01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:03.020
this is the term that we use, what you really are saying is that the vibrational impact

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:10.860
of that person is pulling toward it life's impact and it is on the same frequency level.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:18.140
Now as that person allows themselves, and this usually often has to happen in times of crises,

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:23.740
in times of crises we act in different ways. We have the power at certain junctures of

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:29.940
life when a call is made, this is why crises are so important, the crises come into the

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:39.500
life of say this so-called lower evolved person, the crises break them into, jolt them into

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:49.380
an asking. Now, they'd ask, this is our chance, you see, because prior to that we cannot,

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:54.080
You see, we cannot just keep hounding that person and hounding that person.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.380
Their free will is what motivates what will happen to them.

01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:02.080
The crisis comes, the crack in the armor, they call out in whatever way,

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.280
"Oh my God, help me. If you will help me, I give you promises to do this, this, this."

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.080
So forth, you see. Many times we see this happen.

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.580
Many times they renege on them in later times, you see.

01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.080
All these promises are just forgotten.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.480
That is not the point. The point is that at that moment there is a cry.

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.080
The vibrational entity has said, "Help!"

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:28.080
The minute this cry comes, we then begin our movement.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.280
And we move with them as long as they are.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.580
And we would move with that entity until the day the entity chose to move to the light.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:42.580
If they would hold that, you see, if they would hold that call, but they don't.

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:48.340
the crisis is resolved, they go back to their normal way of existing,

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.580
they're very grateful that they're still, you know, all right and whatever,

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:57.220
or if their son has been saved or, you know, many times you see this kind of thing.

01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:02.740
The promises are forgotten, or if they're done, they're done as just a debt to be paid.

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:08.260
But, but, with that call, something has happened, you see.

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:18.060
Now, with that little wedge, they are then able to have another light harmony move for them.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:26.360
You see? It's as if there's a crack in the sphere, and the light rushes into that sphere, and it remains there.

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.860
And it draws to it, its own likeness now, which is light. You see?

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:38.660
And eventually, as the years go on, as lives go on, more crises happen as is the designated time.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:46.060
One of the main reasons for crises is to continually crack this sphere open more and more and more and more

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:52.460
until it is nothing but a ball of gold and white. That is what you're really aiming for.

01:37:52.460 --> 01:38:00.160
As each one of these crises enters in, it cracks it open more and more, and each time, you see, more rushes in.

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:06.400
You see, and that gives them a greater chance the next time to call it light form, because light calls light.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:12.900
You see, and much of the sphere may still have, pressing on it, the negative similarities,

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.400
but then we mustn't forget that that is also here, this light.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.900
And what happens so often, you see a young child with a great many problems and you think, "Poor thing, poor thing."

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:26.900
From our perception, this is not true.

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.700
You see, it is often the opposite.

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.900
Some of the strongest entities in the life cycle

01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:35.900
are those whose childhoods were extremely difficult.

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:40.900
Because it's at these junctures that they intuitively call out

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.900
and bring into them, through their call, more of the light.

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.900
You see what I mean?

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.900
The child that has a perfect upbringing

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.900
and has a lot of joy and a lot of love,

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:54.900
oftentimes will find in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and so forth,

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:58.900
and they begin to have the craft and the spirit.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.900
Now this is something that's set up ahead of time and doesn't need to concern us.

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:08.900
It's set up in certain ways because of certain desires.

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:16.900
Some of the hardest incarnations are taken on because of the entity's deep desire to get on with it.

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:20.900
You know, through this thought process of this in one lifetime.

01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:27.900
And although things on the outside look tremendously difficult, actually they've been wise in many

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900
ways.

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:33.180
But I still sense your question.

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.380
There was no Louisa Aitken two lifetimes ago.

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.980
There wasn't even someone who now, we now call Louisa Aitken.

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:46.020
In the changes that have gone, that she has gone through, not only as an incarnate being,

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:52.020
But in the freedom of the other planes in between her incarnations, there is no likeness at all.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:53.020
There is residue.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.020
And this is what we speak to in this particular point.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.020
There is a residue.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.020
[inaudible]

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.020
Yes, yes.

01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.020
[inaudible]

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:01.020
Yes, that is the kind of meaning that I'm seeking to convey.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:02.020
[inaudible]

01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.020
Right.

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:09.020
Yes, that is the kind of meaning that I'm seeking to convey.

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:13.020
Right, now had this woman...

01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:20.020
It didn't have to be this particular woman from two lifetimes ago.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:25.020
Had you been aware earlier in this lifetime, there were other instances,

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.020
other connections with other people that could have removed this from you.

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:35.020
from you. But the fact was that you at those particular junctions of your life you were

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:40.260
working on other things. You see there's only so many things that you can deal with at once.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:45.020
And so we're always learning. And we move from one awareness to another you see. And

01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:50.820
now here is this one coming at a very right time. Right for you and right for her. The

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:56.020
circumstances are set. You have the time. You're not working on anything else at the

01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:02.100
moment this gives you the breathing space to work with it and deal with it and remove it

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:03.100
from your life.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.100
Do you see it?

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.100
Did I answer your question?

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.100
I can see it.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:20.980
Do I understand that you have been my teacher or do I have another teacher?

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:21.980
I am not your primary teacher.

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:28.980
I think we should e-postpone that.

01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:35.980
I think we should even postpone that.

01:41:35.980 --> 01:42:01.120
The

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:09.280
The type of connection that we seek to make, and we can make that, is best done in the

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:16.040
hours of the night when the world, the place in the world where you exist is in a quieter

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.040
state.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:24.200
It will be easier on the woman at that time.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:30.120
The channels would be much easier for her in the evening.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.120
She has a certain intuitive movement with her child.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:41.120
And in the evening when the child is in bed and taken care of and she can remove this

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.120
situation from her mind, she is much freer to do this.

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:53.120
And we have to be careful of her too because she, you know, she's a part of this whole

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.120
process and we are trying to be as understanding about her needs as possible.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:04.200
But by all means, and please ask it again in an evening situation, and I feel quite sure

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.200
at this time that something of that nature can be done.

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.200
I find that Jim Pope has been a speaker for a long time.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.200
No, that is not true.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.200
He thinks he has very much said.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200
And it would be wonderful if there would be any advice you could give him.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200
I think that he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200
I think he has been a very good speaker.

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.200
And he wonders whether there would be any advice you could give him.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:39.200
None of this that I say now should be repeated.

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.200
Because he would not be able to hear it.

01:43:47.200 --> 01:44:00.200
But the image of this gentleman is one of many, many layers of desires.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:12.200
It's almost as if there is layers and layers of serpents of desires winding around the pole of his center being.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.200
Is the image clear to you?

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.200
And there are many, many of them around the center core.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.200
And...

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:30.200
He is drawn to the quest

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:41.200
because of the core of the being, which is, of course, the same core as mankind.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:48.200
time. But in this particular case, he would be much better to spend his time forgetting,

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:57.880
almost putting aside the question of the spiritual quest, and concentrating on the human quest.

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:05.360
That he is not even a successful person in a functioning sense in the human material

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:14.680
world. And there is no grounding. He is not grounded in the sense that he is always in

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:21.120
a state of flux. I see this energy is given of movement, constant movement, not movement

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:27.120
upwards or movement downwards, but just kind of a dissipated movement in all directions,

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.000
which is interpreted to mean that his energies are simply going off in all directions and

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:40.180
There is no... a person who is that dissipated in the sense of energy and in the sense of

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:47.760
desire, he has no desire that he dissipates at will.

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:55.360
There's no steady, compact, concentrated impulse.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.660
It is all dissipated.

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:01.660
What we will say to him is this.

01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:07.660
Are you going to play a tape for him?

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.660
No, not right now.

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:18.660
I think it might be better if you simply give him a quote and then just tell him that the tape is with a woman or whatever.

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:24.660
Because I do not feel that he needs to be chastised.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:32.660
Jesus' problem is similar to many people.

01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:40.660
He's drawn to the spiritual world because he seeks to avoid responsibility.

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:55.660
And he feels that if you are a spiritual seeker, then you can overlook many of the mundane responsibilities that a human body is expected to perform.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:09.500
Our advice to him is to spend a considerable amount of time looking within and finding

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:16.660
the thing that at the moment it seems to him he most wants to do, whatever it may be.

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:22.820
On the physical plane now I'm speaking, I speak in terms of work, in terms of jobs, this type

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:31.740
of things. And whatever he decides to make a vow within himself that for five years he

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:42.860
will remain with it. Five years. And stay with it. And in that time to not indulge in mind

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:48.100
fantasies of what he would like to be doing. But to keep the power, do you see what we're

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:56.740
aiming at. That if he can keep himself in a compact situation, if he has promised himself

01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:04.780
that he will remain in a certain place for five years, he will draw to him the concentrated,

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:14.180
compact consciousness that is the primary prerequisite before you can even begin the most elementary

01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:20.300
stages of a spiritual path. And you see this gentleman doesn't have it. And one of the

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.380
reasons he doesn't have it is his continual moving from place to place and thing to thing

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:29.300
and person to person and thought to thought and fantasy to fantasy. He needs to become

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:39.940
compact. So, five years, one job. That's it. And no fantasies. Please make this very clear

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:45.200
to him, it will not do him any good to stay in one thing for five years, gritting his

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.960
teeth with the determination of, "I hate this. I don't want to be here. I wish I were doing

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:58.560
A, B, and C." The idea is to get his mind so concentrated on what he is doing that he would

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:09.440
be able to perceive the joy that is inherent in any occupation. In any occupation, there

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:21.140
is inherent in it, a spontaneous joy, a spontaneous enjoyment, participation, all things are possible

01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:28.680
in any position you think. So this would be our advice to him, a five year commitment and

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:37.960
see if he can work for it. Now make no other statements around it, for example, please don't

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:44.960
say, a five-year commitment to one woman, for example. That would be extremely unwise. And

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:52.040
do not in any way please stress disciplines like whatever he chooses to do on that periphery

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:58.120
is really not important. It will be sufficient unto the day if he will be able to do this

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:05.120
one thing of finding this spontaneous joy and creation and creative response in one job

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:07.680
for five years.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:08.680
Now the woman has a question.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680
What would help her to overcome her oversensitive reactions when negativity is directed at her?

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:10.680
Well, that's a good question because it's plagued her for many years.

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:11.680
Basically, she needs to understand one thing.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.680
The negativity that comes from others to her is essentially a negative.

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:14.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:15.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:16.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:19.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:20.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.680
It's a negative that comes from others to her.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:28.680
Well, that's a good question because it's plagued her for many years.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.680
Basically, she needs to understand one thing.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:40.680
The negativity that comes from others to her is essentially not terribly important.

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.680
She tends to feel that things are more important than they really are.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.680
She...

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:53.680
Someone will say something to her, the person who says it to her is perhaps being very casual about it

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.680
and doesn't even think about it in the next five minutes

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:03.680
but she herself is taking it in and broods on it and worries on it and so forth, you see.

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:10.680
Now, this is an old habit and can easily be broken and it must be broken and it's in the process of being broken

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:16.160
And the step that she has to take is the minute that she feels, for example, someone says

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:29.480
something to her that hurts, that makes her feel unworthy or depressed or inferior or

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.560
there are many things that one could feel.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:35.840
And by the way, this applies to many people and not just to the woman herself.

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:43.880
The first thing, the first thing that should cross her conscious mind is, "I choose not

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.920
to dwell in it."

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:52.720
And then, if she still feels the pull of that kind of, because all it is is an indulgence

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:58.720
in a negative kind of a thought situation, then all she has to do is to say, "I choose

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:05.460
to dwell in," and then pick something else, "whatever, whatever is most joyful for her."

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:13.660
In her case, most definitely, just to choose to dwell in the presence of God, which is

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:20.500
very much what she does most of the time, is try to feel, even to the physical feeling

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.100
of the God presence around her.

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:29.140
She is moving into that kind of an awareness and is able often to feel the pulsations of

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.700
the higher forces directly around her.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:36.540
And if she will just make a conscious choice of saying, "I don't choose that," you see,

01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:41.700
and then not to continue to think on these things, to drop it and to select to choose

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.060
this other and to move into those feelings.

01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:50.460
I think she will find in, I would predict in weeks, not months, in weeks, that she would

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:52.420
be able to drop that.

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:58.300
And I would suggest to other people who might have access to this data, the same process.

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:02.600
Each time something comes into your consciousness you have a choice.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.880
You can take it in and become obsessed with it and deal with it and worry about it or

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.540
you can say I choose something else and select whatever it is that brings light to your mind

01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:14.540
rather than darkness.

01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.580
It's simply a choice.

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:21.340
If a symbol of the void is beautiful that should be dwelt on.

01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:26.500
If the light or the cross or the Christ or the whatever, those symbols should be, that

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:27.500
is what they're for.

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:33.500
The symbols of the world are there for you to use, and that's the kind of time that we

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.500
ask you to use them.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:43.500
We also like your opinion on the Court of Miracles, which you follow.

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:51.500
Well, I think it's a wonderful thing, and I highly encourage her in all aspects of it.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:57.380
Now it is not for everyone and she must be aware that there will be much criticism and

01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:03.820
in ensuing years there will be a controversy over this course because it professes as you

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:09.380
know to come from the Christ himself and there will be a great deal of controversy.

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:17.100
Now she has thought about this herself and the answer for her is, I believe you're all

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:23.740
aware of the fact that the Course says that it is Jesus himself that speaks. And in a

01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:29.740
sense this is absolutely true. There is nothing in that Course that does not come from the

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:39.140
highest source of the Christ vibration. Now, it is really not important to say, "Does it

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:44.860
come from the persona that we consider to be Jesus?" There is nothing that is in that

01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:56.060
course that does not reflect the highest, the highest that the Christ as personified by

01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:05.900
Jesus has to offer. And she can go into it without any trepidation whatsoever. Many people

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:10.620
will not understand it. I do not encourage her to talk about it. I think that she should,

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:15.260
especially around very orthodox Christians,

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.980
should make absolutely no mention of it.

01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:21.260
They will do what they can to undermine it.

01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.540
And she should just let them go on their way,

01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:27.420
because everybody needs what they need.

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:33.020
And this is a very definite response to her soul call for guidance.

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:37.180
And I use it often to connect with her,

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.460
because she believes in it.

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:42.960
She, you see, she responded immediately to the deep truth that lies there.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:48.960
And she is able to throw out the extraneous and to dwell on the essence of it.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:52.460
And this is why for her it's so very vital that she continue with it.

01:55:52.460 --> 01:56:00.460
Because she is able out of all the pages and pages to pick those kernels that are the highest.

01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:11.060
and to begin to believe what it is that she needs to believe, that she is, you see, a part of this whole drama of God.

01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:13.060
So yes, by all means.

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:16.060
You mentioned the persona of Jesus.

01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:24.060
Yes, what you said about the changing constantly, the persona of Jesus no longer exists, but the Christ did exist.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:32.620
The persona of Jesus is in a sense so much more powerful, so much more radiant, so much

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:39.780
more awe-inspiring than it was two thousand years ago, that were we to meet him on the

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:46.580
earth plane today as they did then, it is doubtful that any physical vehicle could encompass.

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:50.180
I mean, he too has moved to realms, you see.

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:51.180
There is no end.

01:56:51.180 --> 01:57:01.180
It is hard to explain, but there is no end to the capacity to expand into the total Godness.

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:04.380
Did you want me to stop?

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:14.060
There is no end to the infinite, and the persona of Jesus in the two thousand years since he

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:22.860
he left the earth plane, has continued to radiate and to grow in life and wisdom, that those

01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:29.660
who tune into him now are given so much more than they were two thousand years ago, you

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:30.660
see?

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:39.340
Because he himself has moved through, he is so much closer to the totality of things than

01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:46.740
he was then, that his gift throughout the centuries increases. You see, it's so funny, the world

01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:54.620
says two thousand years ago, and puts him as an old archaic form. In truth, he is so

01:57:54.620 --> 01:58:01.820
much more now than he ever was, that he is an even greater gift to mankind now than he

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:08.820
was then, you see, and it is so opposite. He is the source that I draw to. He is the source

01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:19.020
that I look to for my wisdom. And in my state of exaltation, I do my very best to reach

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:28.440
the height that he was a two thousand years ago, you see. And he has so far transcended

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:37.400
that now that someone like myself could walk the plane, the earth plane now and be considered

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:45.520
on that vibrational level, but not him. If he came back in the form that he was, I mean

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:54.480
that he is now, well, we won't even speculate about that. But do you, are there any questions

01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:01.480
in the room? Yes, I have a question. Yes? Did you speak on the subject of the second coming

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:11.080
of Jesus Christ? Ah, well, again, there's been an awful lot of misinformation filtered through

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:17.320
various people on this subject. And it is true that he will come again and blessed is

01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:32.240
the world with the crystal.
