00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
and joy and love and protection that is actually totally felt by the great ones who decide

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.360
to immerse themselves. Without that they would never be able to do it. You see, they could

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.480
never do it. You're not left alone. Never, never, never are you left alone. The human

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.800
being reflects the world. They see separateness. They see being abandoned. They see that the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.280
The love that they have is left, the love that they have is dead, their children, all these

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.160
things happen and they believe that to be the reality.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200
So we say do not count on your eyes, alright?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Don't trust your eyes.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680
Your eyes will deceive you always.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.600
Your eyes are not the vehicle to be truthful.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
The inner mechanism is the vehicle to feel and experience truthfulness.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
And those who go this path will be people who spend hours in this communion, I mean

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.660
in the midst of their work will be communing.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.320
You see, you don't have to be locked in a cell

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.680
to do this communing.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.860
It can be a constant, ever-present, ever-vitalizing,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.360
ever-moving thing.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.640
Have I made this clear?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.140
Very good.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.640
Yes.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120
Wonderful.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.620
Thank you.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.680
Do you have any suggestions on how

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.680
we can come more close to this ultimate surrender.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:41.680
There's only one rule, desire. Desire is first, second, third, fifth, thousandth, upon us.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.680
If it is your first and your greatest desire, if it pulsates through your being with the desire, you will not lose it.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.680
You cannot be refused. But all of the things that they ask you.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.680
And if you can be this moment I want it and then the next moment I don't.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680
You see, it's this fluctuating of desire that so defeats the victory.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680
So the only thing, how then to achieve this one-pointedness?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.680
It's very simple. Work at it.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.680
It's like everything else that you ever do.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.680
How do you become a doctor? You work at it.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
You work at it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.680
And this is how you seek what you would choose to call enlightenment, what I call freedom.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.680
You see? You become free by working at it.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.680
The books have been written. Everyone in this room knows the rules.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.680
You see? There aren't any of us that don't know the rules.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680
We know.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680
Everyone in the vast universe knows the rules of all of the things that they're asked to do.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.680
And a human being knows the rules under which he should operate in order to move into this state.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680
But you have to forget it.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
People are lazy.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680
You know that, sir.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Human beings are very lazy.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
And they can get the momentum going for certain things, you see.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.680
And it differs for each person.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.320
But pretty soon that becomes old and jaded and tiring.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.860
You know, even the great millionaires,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.640
if you speak with them, you will find

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.960
that this great movement for great money

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.240
becomes a jaded affair.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.040
And then something else takes its place.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.440
You see, and this is true of the intellectual.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.040
You know, at one point, they become

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.280
tired with burning, this burning mind and so forth.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.040
And the lecturer becomes very bored with the body.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.200
Soon, eventually, somewhere down the line,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.700
They're all the same, the experience is the same, and is that all there is?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.700
You see, no matter where you take it, eventually it becomes a dead, a dead life.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700
Because in truth, it is dead.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.700
The thing that makes life worth, eternally worth living, is that quest that we are speaking of.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.700
So, just work on it.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.700
And be aware of one thing, which many people perhaps are not aware of.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.220
I think we have spoken of this before, but I will repeat it again and in this instance,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220
because I feel it's an important thing.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.820
For every movement that you make, please be aware, an incredible amount of movement is made towards you.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.220
You see, it is all done out of love.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.220
The love is a pulsating reality that is so crowding in upon your consciousness

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.220
that sometimes we marvel that your brain's the only love really.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.220
There is just a constant real reality pushing on your very self because this is what you're made of.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.220
Because if you were to see what you really are, you are light and you are love. That is what you are.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:45.220
And anything else that you perceive, I care not how high you go, you can see the greatest, the highest diva,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.220
The greatest God that ever lived, in a poem, the highest vision you will ever see is life

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.220
and love moving in total harmony and it is everywhere.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.220
It is everywhere.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.220
That would be the significance of the Buddhist wisdom and compassion.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.220
Wisdom being life, compassion working on love.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.220
Exactly, exactly.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.220
These things move and they move together.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.220
They move in harmony, you see, because one without the other has no meaning.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.220
The two of them must move and they do move. They are absolutely one of a whole.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.220
This is why the best couples often represent both aspects.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.220
The mind and the wisdom in one, and the love and the compassion in the other.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.220
And because then you see they can make the exchange. They can learn one from the other.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.220
Neither of them is the more desirable trait.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.120
Successfully, they will have a better mirror to reflect that, you see.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.620
And this is one thing that the women in the world, you see,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.220
I hope that this will not be taken ill by some of the people whom I hear this day,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.320
but the fact remains that the woman's chief job, and the reason that one takes a female body,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.620
is to learn gentleness and compassion.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.420
These are the two true, deep hallmarks of the female.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.900
gentleness with which goes understanding.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.700
You cannot be truly gentle unless you really love him.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.380
These two have to go together.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.900
And compassion then for everyone, I mean everyone.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.940
And a woman, you see you choose what vehicle

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.820
you will manifest in according to what witnesses

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.220
that you have not yet brought to fruition.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.980
So you know, this is very funny,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.700
from our perception all of this,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.360
you can incarnate a thousand times

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.900
And if you have not learned this one,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.160
there's humor from our view of things.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.140
Because so many of these people who

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.240
are doing the loudest chatterings

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.080
have come precisely in the female form

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.040
so that they could learn the very attributes that they are so

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.880
furious-- that they're funny about, you see.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.800
Because one thing that every human being needs to know--

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.560
I care not-- you can incarnate 1,000 times.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.960
And if you have not learned this one attribute,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.680
you will have to come back.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.480
And that is this ability--

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.800
There's too many keys coming up.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.240
No, I'm not being dense.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.440
There are many more keys on the airplane right now

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.400
than there are-- no one.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.840
And if everybody is reading, and everyone is the boss,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.600
and everyone is in control, then there

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.520
means nobody to learn these incredibly beautiful lessons

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.080
of how to be a follower, how to just absolutely be

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.600
willing and joyfully a follower.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.440
There's a tremendous amount of joy in being a follower.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.640
It's just unrealistic.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.600
So I hope I'm Indian.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
I thought you were saying you have too many teeth.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600
I'm not Indian.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.600
There are many more teeth on the airplane right now

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600
than there are Indians.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
I assure you of that.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
And the sad thing is that many of them

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.600
have come to-- that came, took on body forms to be Indian.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.100
But the pull, you see, the tremendous pull

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.100
of this society, especially in the West,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.100
the tremendous emphasis of the bombardment from everywhere,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.600
success lies in the powerful.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
It comes from everywhere. Whoever has the power is a success. This is not the truth.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.600
May I just say, this is not a true perception. Many of the people who carry the power stand in great jeopardy.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.600
Many people who carry the power in the world as it is structured today are in jeopardy because it is false.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600
They are building on a very false basis of power.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:36.600
True power, true power comes from total surrender, of total giving over, of total reception, and of total love.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.600
The person who is the strongest in the world is the person who loves totally,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.600
who will accept anything and everyone in every moment of their life.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.600
That person is most beloved and most fortunate.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.600

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
to their own end.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.600
It is very difficult to explore.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Let me say that many people will not understand what I'm about to say.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.600
This case is really not going to appeal to a great many people.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.600
So I would ask our group to bear this in mind and not be surprised at any adverse reactions

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600
that you might get to those people.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.600
I am going to speak on free will at the highest level that I feel all of you are able to understand it.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.600
And therefore there will be many of you who will fall away and not be able to understand it.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.600
But I would like to because I feel that my friends and supporters as well as myself and my wife will be able to understand what I'm saying.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.600
So without that then I'm really speaking.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.600
[inaudible]

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:15.600
The challenge that we experience can only be understood with the background of realizing that the Father allows you to go out and be yourself.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:41.600
[Unintelligible]

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.160
The only time the divine will and yours are united in harmony is when you say,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.360
"I have observed that following my own will, I get into difficulties.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.840
I do not like the will, the life that my own separate will has created.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:05.320
Therefore, I turn to your Father, or the divine or the great power, however you manifest this question.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:11.240
I turn to that great power and ask that my will join with yours

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.840
in order to fulfill the plan as you would really like to see it.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.640
Do you understand?

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640
I do, thanks.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.340
There is no way that—

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.140
and this is why we laugh on our side,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.440
it's not very humorous, but nevertheless it often happens—

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.540
that people on the Earth plane tend to think that God is running their life,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:39.440
and they take great joy in doing very strange and weird and wonderful little fantasies

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.440
that are totally their own and give God the credit.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440
And this is really not the way it is.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440
It isn't set up this way at all.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:57.440
The truth of the situation is that free will is simply something that happens no matter how we would wish it to be otherwise.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.440
[The patient is shown a video of a patient who is in a critical condition.]

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440
All right.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.940
The vehicle is experiencing tremendous difficulty,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.440
and I would send one of the city times

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.440
or the other master of whom we spoke.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:27.940
Oh, yeah.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.440
To come in and look at it and see how it works.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:48.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440
[The mother is shown in the operating room with her son, who is in the operating room.]

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:07.440
I'll take this time for my presence to come into this work.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.440
We are grateful.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:18.440
We will see how well it works and how well the vehicle is able to work with it.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:29.440
It may be necessary to have a movement from one to the other of us in order to facilitate

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.440
the use of a physical vehicle with a woman.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:43.440
So, we will present a picture to you of free will.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.240
Let us envision a vast sphere.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:58.240
Protruding from this vast sphere is a small area of the vastness.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:05.040
This small protrusion is able to look upon itself,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.840
and is able to see itself, and feels itself a separate protrusion.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.240
It feels itself separate from the vastness.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.240
Now, the question we would put to you is, is there but one will, there can be no separation

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:30.240
between the will of the vastness and the will of the subsistence, do you understand?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
I do.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.240
There is but one will that moves through us all as God's will.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:44.240
There are no two wills. There is not a separate will for each individual, plus a vast will.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:52.240
I realize fully that this is the perception of most people, and indeed if we were not talking from the highest level,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.240
I would agree with the statement that there are two wills, and that one's will must join with another.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.240
For example, my brother just spoke of those things, do you remember?

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.240
Yes.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.240
What he says is absolutely true.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.240
I'm trying to give you a picture of the stage above that perception,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:19.240
because I feel that there are a few of you listening to these tapes who might be able to grasp the reality and make good use of it.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.240
So I will proceed in the hope that this is correct.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.240
Again, the vast circle with the co-proven coming out of it, there is but one will.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.240
If you can say to me then why is it that there is such distraction, why is the world in such chaos?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.240
Is this going to be interpreted as the will of the one vastness?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:54.240
The answer is, all that you perceive on the physical plane, the distraction, the anger, the hatred, the partisanship, are an illusion.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.240
There is no will upholding those illusions, sir.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:06.240
There is, I repeat, there is no will upholding those occurrences.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.240
College, can you take this very simply?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:22.240
Whatever gives birth, rises, and falls back again into death of any form, is not upheld by the vast will.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.240
Anything that changes from moment to moment is not upheld by the God's will.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.240
The only things that are upheld by the God's will last eternally.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.240
Do you understand me?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.240
Yes, I think I understand.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:49.240
The illusion is that there is a will acting in opposition to God's will,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.240
and this is insanity.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:01.240
There is no possibility of anything being upheld by God that is not eternal.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.240
It cannot be done.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.240
God moves eternally.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:12.240
The play on the earth's surface that you see, that you believe to be so real, is false.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.240
It is no substance. It is form. It is form without substance.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:24.240
There is no eternal substance in any of the things that you perceive on the earth plane.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.240
I realize I am asking you to understand something, but it's very difficult.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.240
All of your senses tell you that what you perceive is substance and is in form

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:43.240
and has some type of, you have to mention some kind of continuation of it in some way.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.240
I understand that this is how you perceive it.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.240
I am asking you to begin to doubt this.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:58.240
The doubt is the first stage on opening you up to the vast awareness that is yours if you receive it.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:04.240
The doubt must begin within you to visualize constantly a world and state within yourself.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.240
Somehow, in some way that I do not yet understand, this is an illusion.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.240
What I perceive is an illusion.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.240
and I will therefore hold the great doubt within my belly.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.740
Do you understand me?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740
I do.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.240
There is a very old tradition in the Zen field that says,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.740
"With the great doubt embodied in your heart,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.240
you will come to know that all is Buddha mind."

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.740
This is a very true statement,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.240
and I ask that we keep it in our hearts and in our minds,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.640
that what we are asking of all of you who hear this,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.040
who shall make any sense of it at all,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.640
who contain within you being the great doubt,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.640
and the doubt is this.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.040
All the great enlightened ones have told the Earth beings,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.440
this world is an illusion.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.540
What rises and what falls is an illusion.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.040
There is no substance here.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.140
Humans hear this with their ears and they understand it not.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.780
So we ask that you, although you do not understand it at this time,

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.380
and we are aware that you do not understand it,

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.540
we ask you to share the great doubt with us.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.380
Will you commit to at least that?

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.340
I will.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.980
And ask the woman and your friend in Chicago.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.540
They need to contain the great doubt.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.500
This is the beginning of the vast wisdom.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.980
We know you do not understand.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.700
We simply ask you to begin the process,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.700
and it will work in its own way.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.700
As you look out into the world,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.700
you will perceive

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.700
form after form after form,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.700
and it will seem to you to be so utterly real

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.700
and eternal and strong

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.700
because it will have an impact upon you.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.700
You will feel it, you see,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.700
but the fact is that you are doing

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.700
and are participating in a grand illusion.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.700
The mass movement of all the egos on the Earth

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.700
on the earth plane have created an illusion.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.700
When one incarnates into the world plane,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:19.700
you come in with the understanding that you are creating and participating in an illusion.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.700
Why are you doing this?

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.700
You are doing this because you wish to be seen, to see yourself as separate.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.700
This is why everyone on the earth plane is here except for a few,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:39.700
You have chosen this world to live in because you enjoy the feeling of being a separate entity.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.700
You enjoy this illusion.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.700
When you leave body form, you become aware that it is illusory.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.700
But you still have belonging, you see.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.700
The desire has not left you to become separate, to view yourself as individual.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:59.700
You have chosen this world to live in because you enjoy the feeling of being a separate entity.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:06.700
You come to the earth plane and embark upon this illusion that all of the minds create

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.700
together on the earth plane with the living.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.700
You agree to the rules before you come and you play it out.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:23.700
But there are many of you on the earth plane who are not ready to play it out.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.700
before you come and you pray it out.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.200
Yet, there are many of you on the earth plane at this time

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.200
who are about to face, I no longer wish to participate in the illusion.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:47.700
I see that I do not enjoy and do not feel at one with the illusory world that we have all created.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:59.940
I find it displeasing to my greatest prior awareness, and so I now select by my own inner will, I say,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:06.900
I wish to become aware once again of my connection with the God-man.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.300
Do you think you understand this?

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.900
I do understand.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.700
Thank you. Do you think others will understand this?

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.700
Yes, I do.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.700
I know we will have to deal with it again and again from different perspectives,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.700
because although I know, I sense that you understand, there will be many who will not.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.700
And our only hope is to make as many understand as we can.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:37.700
The last thing that I will say before returning this over to my brother is,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:49.500
Beware that once a human entity decides that the illusion no longer is die-fine, she will

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.500
seek a way out.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:00.500
The moment she does that, she is now moving back into the withdrawing as a separate protrusion

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.500
back into the vastness of the One.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.500
Do you understand that?

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.500
I do.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:15.500
and with movement back into the vast one that you on the earth plane call the spiritual path.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.500
In order to do this, often times it is extremely essential that you have helpers

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:27.500
who have returned themselves to the vastness, but retained a small spot of separateness,

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.500
not from any ego desire, but from an incredible love for truth.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.900
and instead we choose to go back out into a separate one, a separateness, in order to serve you.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.900
These are the great ones, if you choose to call them that.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.900
They are great and should be given all due reverence,

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.900
because the job that they have taken on on behalf of mankind is tremendous,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:24:00.900
and without their willing participation, it would be extremely difficult for you to withdraw from the illusion and return to the staff.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.900
This is why we ask that all praise and glory be given to the great ones who come.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.900
This is the point and purpose of ritual that blesses the Christ, that blesses the Buddha,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:22.900
that gives honors and thanksgiving to those images, not because the images matter at all,

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.900
but because of the tremendous service that they do mankind that mankind is utterly unaware of.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.900
Have our neighbors understood this?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.900
You have, Luther, in one tradition, as they call it, the Buddhists.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.900
That is true. The closest word for this is "Buddhist doctor," because they have been understood to this.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.900
Now, there are Buddhist doctors in all religions.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.900
There is not a religion, for example, you do not only have buddhashatras in the buddhist religion.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.900
There are many buddhashatras in the Christian faith.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.900
Great and wonderful.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.900
We do love the earthling.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:09.900
The one that is foremost in the life of the woman Christian is the antichrist who has been come to known on the earth plane as Saint Francis of Assisi.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.900
He is very much her buddhashatra.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.900
It is this tremendous light that generates in him that has taught me so much in the past about the knowledge of God.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.900
Your, sir, is a Buddhist chaplain known as Plato.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.900
We are Buddhist chaplains, you see.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:39.900
Therefore, I feel that the woman is destined to return to my brother.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.900
[Unintelligible]

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.900
Before I go,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.900
I would give you instructions if you wish to take a break.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.900
Oh, yeah.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.900
When a woman travels north, it's safe.
