00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Bartholomew talks for the Quest group about the purpose or meaning of life.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, first I'd like to...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.680
I feel that the difficulty in answering a question of this nature

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.560
in a particular group situation is that various ones will be seeking different answers,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.560
but I would like to say that I will give the answer

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.560
in the highest degree that I perceive,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.040
and those that can hear will hear,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.040
and those that cannot will someday also come to hear.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:07.040
The question that our side of the light would like to impress

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.160
upon all of the human consciousness

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.160
is simply that the purpose of life is not at all what your perception would tell you it was.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.160
From your human perception, looking out through the eyes, physical eyes,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.160
you perceive life and its importance as being bound up in family,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:49.360
work, love in the personal sense, in the children's sense, in the mate's sense, or in love of

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.440
parents, or love of country, or love of good work, or however it manifests to you.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.680
Now while no one on this side of the light would say that these are wrong motives, they

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:15.960
they would say that as long as you believe this illusion, you will not be able to fully

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:29.000
participate in the broad ongoing teaching that the planet provides for you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What is meant by this is simply that your eyes lie to you.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.280
You are using, most of you, are using the wrong vehicle to see with.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:56.040
The vehicle that you are called upon to see with is an inner vehicle that has no form

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440
of what you are aware.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.000
It is made up of spirals of energy fields which we will not go into because when your eyes,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.120
when your inner eyes are developed enough to see them then you will know within your own

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.640
mind what you are perceiving.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:24.440
But just let me say that when these inner eyes open you will then perceive the world totally

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.240
differently from the way you do now.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.360
In that new perception, you will become one with all of the great truths that the greatest

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.160
of the teachers have passed down to you.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.720
You say, all of you, or some of you, you say countless times, "All is one.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.560
There is only one reality."

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.640
But if you are being honest, and if you will look carefully at your mind, you will observe

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.640
that your thoughts deny that you truly believe it.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.640
You act constantly in opposition to this basic idea.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.640
Indeed, you act not only as if you were separate,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.640
but as if your mind is separate from other minds.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
It is bad enough to think that your body is separate from other bodies,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.440
but on top of this illusion you compound it by feeling that your mind is somehow a separate

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.600
entity from the rest of the mind in the world.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:46.680
We would like to say that this is an illusion created by the ego for its own use and if

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.000
you choose to continue, that's fine.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.680
This is a matter of choice.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.320
There are certain delights to be found in seeing oneself as separate.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.920
Some of these delights are obvious.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.560
For example, if you happen to be in a fulfilling personal relationship, then you see the obvious

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.760
delight of feeling a one-to-one love.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.280
On the other hand, it must be seen clearly that if you move from a fulfilling relationship

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.920
to areas of that relationship that are not fulfilling, then watch carefully what your

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:36.360
mind does, because your mind then says, "Ah, it is simply this particular relationship that

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.640
has gone sour, so now I will go out and find another personal relationship that will then

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.140
be meaningful to you. And so it goes. Time after time, life after life, relationship

00:05:51.140 --> 00:06:00.640
after relationship, one forgets and puts aside the pain and the suffering and forgets that

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:10.480
the purpose of life is to understand that you are not an ego. It is as simple as that.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.000
The purpose of everyone in this room is to come to the awareness that you are not now

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.200
and have never been an ego.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.360
I am very aware of having been incarnate for myself.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.160
I am very aware of the tremendous pull of the illusion.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.840
But having moved out of that illusion, I have come to tell you that it can be done.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.680
And if you are still caught in the illusion, rest assured it is because it is giving you

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.280
something that you deeply want.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:58.320
So don't beat your chest and cry to the gods and say, "You are not fulfilling me.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.140
You are not showing me the way."

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.480
The way is always there.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.720
But most of you, if you would be honest, would see that you are very content on some deep

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.720
level with what you are doing.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.040
It feeds you in some way.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.680
It makes you feel important.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.880
And you see, if all is one, then no one is any more important than anyone else.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.560
And this is something that the ego refuses to see.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:41.140
The ego maintains its power over you by promising you a special state.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.640
You are special if you are a separate ego.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.680
If you are not a separate ego, you see, then where is the specialness?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.320
Where does your specialness lie?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.760
It doesn't exist.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.120
And that is something that the ego screams at.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:07.480
So please be very aware that you get precisely what you want, that what your life is now

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.280
is what you choose it to be, that the instant that you choose differently, doorways will

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280
open.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.320
We cannot tell you which doorway because when the time comes, the combination of energies

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.720
will be there for you and you will begin to experience something else.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:34.960
a way will open but nothing can be done on our side until you ask and I don't mean a

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:44.380
superficial kind of a whimpering but a real soul call any true soul call is always answered

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:53.680
and answered instantaneously so I realize that many on the so-called spiritual path tend

00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.680
to feel that they are in some way special from the rest of mankind.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:10.360
This is a misuse of the spiritual quest.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:19.920
Anything that makes you feel any way different from every other man is a misuse because there

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.240
is no real difference.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.240
that we tend to use these devices when one is in a body.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.240
We use these devices to separate ourselves.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:38.240
And I would ask you all to be extremely careful about this.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:49.240
Some of you are in marriage relationships or in non-married but close relationships with mates.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:57.160
And herein lies one of the greatest misuses of the spiritual quest, which is the insidious

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:07.040
feeling that you emanate to your mate that make them feel less.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.720
And I would like to say that things are not always as they seem.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:20.680
For example, the long-suffering mate who continually stays home and takes care of the family so

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.960
that the other party can go out to meetings, it is questionable, you see, who is really

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.800
the more caring and the more dedicated.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:43.080
So be very careful in all of your thought processes as you go through these pathways that you

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:57.360
don't take on the really deadly habit of thinking yourself exalted because you have some glimmering

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.360
of a spiritual truth.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.440
More on purpose with

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.440
special attention to the life beyond the physical plane.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.400
Can you express anything regarding the overall purpose

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400
further than what you already said.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:35.400
I think that several members of the group are

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.400
interested in

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.400
what happens beyond the event that you called out.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.400
And there's much written about this place.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.400
Most of it is erroneous,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.400
because in order to speak these things,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.400
words have to be used, symbols have to be called on

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.400
that really do not exist in a parallel fashion on the other side.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.400
So much of it is filtered and very foggy,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.640
and therefore misleading.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.960
I think it is fair assumption that most people,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.960
unless they are highly developed, highly aware,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.640
have an underlying fear of death and the whole process

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.640
and the other, waking on the other side, as they call it.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:50.700
So with that in mind, I will do my best, but again one has to understand that the symbols

00:12:50.700 --> 00:13:03.520
given are going to be misrepresented by the woman because she simply doesn't have the ability

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.640
to translate these things for you.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:19.640
Let me just say that the moment of transition varies greatly with the person going off.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:32.280
And the degree of fear is measured with the, what shall I call it, the disorientation that

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.480
is experienced.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:42.760
Some humans pass over with absolutely no change of perception, but they're very rare.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:49.760
Now the main thing that you have to keep in mind is that when you move over to the other

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.280
side, your consciousness does not explode into a tremendous difference than it was on this

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.720
side, because you see there really is no other end here.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.600
It's all the same.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.560
But in order to make any sense at all, we speak in these terms.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:15.720
But when the transition is being made, the general tendency of the human is to concentrate

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.800
on the body form as long as it can.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.680
It is deeply suggested that those of you who can free yourself of that and keep your awareness

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.840
of your consciousness as your primary function at that time, that will be a tremendous help

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.320
to you. Because you see, there is only fear in the body sense, there is no fear in the

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.240
consciousness sense, because the consciousness does not change. There is no alteration in

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:53.280
your consciousness when you die. So if you want to keep the flow of continuity as much

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:01.500
as you can and do your best to learn about this process as you're going, then the suggestion

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.560
is to really let the body take care of itself and do whatever it is destined to do and keep

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.040
your awareness highly concentrated, as power-packed as you can in your consciousness.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.360
Now, on the other side, it will differ.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.360
It is really difficult to make any statement about this type of thing.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:31.840
It is fair to say that what you envision it will be like, so will it be for a limited

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.400
period of time.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.720
Because one of the great things that you will learn is that the mind creates.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.920
And as you are creating this type of a reality on the other side, you will realize that this

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.620
This is what's happening, that your mind is creating something.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.920
But be that as it may, there isn't too much to say.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.660
It'll all be taken care of.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.080
That is the primary thing that I think is of importance to all humans.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:07.640
It's to get a really deep feeling and knowledge within that just as you are sustained by the

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.160
divine force while you're in body form, you are sustained by the divine force when you

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
are not.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:23.160
So the degree to which all the people in this room spend the rest of their life here, creating

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:34.800
this very definite, concrete almost, awareness of their oneness with the divine force that

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.240
is pulsating through them constantly, the less fear there will be, the less change there

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:47.400
will be the greater the greater expanding and and experience the greater the experience

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.680
will be on the other side and by that I mean it will not be as limited.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.880
Someone who goes over with limitations as to who they are will experience those limitations

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.880
to some degree on the other side.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:06.760
But the ones who have really worked at feeling the tremendous harmony that sings through their

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:14.760
being here now in body form, we'll find that it is a continuing process and that it isn't

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:23.840
even so much even going as they say from one room to another, even that is too much of a

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.600
limitation.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.760
What does free them so much is the dropping of all of the physical which is a tremendous

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.760
And this is what they experience as such a lightening.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.760
Because the physical vehicle, it can be very cumbersome.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.760
Yes.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.760
Would you ask a question?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.760
Yes. What can you suggest the best way for parents to help their children?

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:07.240
Well, I'll make it a little more concise this time, but basically I would like to suggest

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:17.720
to everyone who is a parent or is thinking of becoming a parent that their primary consideration

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:29.160
must be to, if they wish to be truly successful in this, in the rearing of children who will

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:39.040
be in harmony and who will have a joyful relationship to life, that the thing that they really must

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:47.680
do if they find it in themselves to do, is to develop this day and the next day and all

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:58.240
days, henceforward, an actual living relationship with the wisdom that is available in the moment.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:07.000
Now, this is a very specific thing and not something vague.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.360
Most of parents, when they find that they are going to become a parent or if the child is

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.600
already born or if some difficulty looms ahead,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.680
they rush around and they read books on so-called experts.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.960
And the data that they receive seems to them to be helpful in some degree or other.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.320
But if they were paying attention, they would realize that there is no particular way,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:43.240
in an overall sense, of knowing how to respond to each instance' problem.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.700
Now there is a way, you see, you are not alone.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.740
None of you have been left alone here to battle your way

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.840
to awareness alone of what's right for you.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.000
I mean, that would be a very unfortunate, chaotic kind of universe

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.840
that you were thinking of.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.240
But the fact remains that most of you enjoy this separate feeling

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.200
as we've talked about before.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.940
You enjoy a sense of being a separate entity

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.000
and you enjoy the power of making your own decisions.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.160
And as long as that is what you want, then by all means, continue to make your own decisions

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.720
to decide every detail down to the last as to what you should do for your child.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:35.280
But for those of you who have come to the understanding through watching your own life, that perhaps

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.040
you have made some mistakes, that perhaps things could have been handled in a better way.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.000
Now if you are one of those, this is for you.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.360
If you really have come to this understanding, and if you are really in enough love state

00:20:52.360 --> 00:21:00.560
with the child to truly wish to serve that child the best you can, then I say to you

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:09.720
the best thing you can do is to develop your tuning device so that the wisdom that is pulsating

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.020
around you constantly will be able to record itself in you and therefore you will know

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.020
what to do.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.080
You see, it is not a mystery.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.600
There are no mysteries here.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.320
Man beats his breath and screams to the sky and says, "I don't know what to do."

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.280
Well, that's because his mind has not been able to think of an answer.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.360
But rest assured the answer is there.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.440
And for parents, we are particularly concerned with the raising of children in this age and

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.720
the next few ages to come, because a lot depends on that, which is another subject.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.760
But a lot depends on what happens to these next few generations.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:58.000
And so any of you who can hear, we would ask you to hear this.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.280
In the moment when your mind is still and you are totally attuned to what is present in

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:14.240
In this moment, with no encumbrances of past thoughts, with no desire beaming at you, but

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:22.460
simply in the quiet of each moment, you will be able to speak the things that need to be

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.680
spoken.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.640
You will be able to think the thought that should be thought, and you will perform what

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.480
the Buddhists would call a right action.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:39.860
Now your mind is incapable of knowing what is right action for everyone in a certain

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.860
area.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.180
At least I think that is true of all in this room.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.480
There are some human beings of course who have transcended but basically the human condition

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:58.100
is one of having a very narrow awareness of what is the best thing to do.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:05.940
So if you choose to be in love and harmony with the total plan and then know that all

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.180
will be served at the highest, it is a very simple matter.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:18.620
You must learn to constantly stop your thought process, to place yourself totally, wholly,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.620
receptively in the moment and listen.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.220
You know, all the great books have said it and you don't hear it.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:36.020
They say God speaks and you know, most people don't understand that.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.160
They don't believe it.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.220
And the reason that they cannot experience the voice of God or the voice within or however

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:50.380
you choose to say it, the reason they cannot experience it is because they're too busy

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.380
talking.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:24:01.380
Now, by this I mean mental talking in the form of thinking, mental fantasies, hopes, fears,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.220
past, future.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:13.540
All of these things tend to fill you to such an extent with your own material that God

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:18.060
simply cannot get through.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:25.900
There is no one in a body that cannot, if they seek it, hear the voice of God.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.220
No one.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.740
And if you doubt me, then I will give you a challenge.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.980
Spend the rest of your life trying, and when you cross over the other side, tell me.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.980
I'll be there.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.980
Are you ready for questions?

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.980
I am.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.980
Are you ready for questions?

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980
I am.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.980
Well, the first question Wilma has,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.980
she wonders whether you can tell her a little bit more about your relationship with her.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:03.980
Well, it's a very healthy time.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:16.740
I've been waiting and hoping that something of this nature would come up because one of

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:26.380
the things that I've been concerned about was her lack of inquisitiveness about me and my

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.700
relationship to her.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.060
In the past, the questions have come from you.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.900
that you have raised, if I'm remembering correctly.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.580
And she had asked on her own.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:49.420
I consider this a healthy question because it means that she is accepting me in a way

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:55.140
that I think she has had difficulty doing in the past.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.220
So I'm glad to speak to them about this relationship.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:09.060
what I think she needs to know, and the question that is foremost in her mind is, I think in

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:15.580
her terminology would be, "Am I her friend?"

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.580
And of course, this is a very true statement.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.580
I've been her friend for a long time.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:31.260
It is also true that I am her teacher, but the thing that she is beginning to sense is

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:40.560
the thing that is closest to the truth, I think, which is that until such time as she can stand

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:48.100
in relationship with the divine, I stand closer to her and therefore serve as a channel for

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.700
her.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:57.940
So in a sense I am just a vehicle at her disposal and I think it would be helpful for her to

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.220
look at it this way.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.740
Her big concern of course, as should be, is the concern of being taken over to such an

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:18.380
extent that there would be no feeling of her own self in this process.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:25.020
But I think that the more she realizes that this is just simply a...

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.300
As I'm a channel, she is a channel.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.460
And that it all comes from the one source.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:37.540
So if you could tell her that, I think she'd feel better about the whole experience that

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.540
she's undergoing.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.060
Because she has had a very hard time with it.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.420
But as we've said before, this is very healthy.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:53.460
We would be very, very unhappy if she was terribly taken over with it, terribly obsessed with

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:59.640
it and this would indicate a tremendous degree of ego involvement which would be a trouble

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.640
for us.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.940
But this isn't true in her case and I think it's healthy and in no way do I wish to discourage

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:12.940
her checking out of the data, her keeping alert to what is true that I speak and what

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.440
is not true.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.440
She needs to do this and I think it's healthy.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.440
So if you tell her that's fine.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440
Thank you.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.440
And I might ask, do you experience yourself in a form,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:32.440
does your consciousness take on a form that seems separate as ours does on our plane?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:39.440
Well, what really is, this is difficult to say,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.440
but what it is is very compact.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.440
If you could see me, if this is the question, if you could see me, if I could materialize

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.280
myself for you, I would be a very compact energy unit, you see.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:59.760
I would be very, very compact and I wouldn't look to you perhaps like a form because you're

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:08.320
used to a very different form, but I would be very, very compact, very liquid, very movable.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.920
I don't hold to any particular form at any time, because thought changes that form instantaneously,

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.560
and so therefore, if I have a thought of one thing, I can move into that form.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560
Do you understand?

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560
I think so.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560
It's a very fluid area.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:30.560
We're told that consciousness always has to have a form through which it can manifest or

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
express.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
Well, this is very true.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560
This is very true.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:45.620
I mean, when you speak in terms of the One, or the vast void, or whatever, that, of course,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:54.360
the both are true, because once you have placed yourself in total relationship with the Divine,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:01.600
once you, if I may use the word, merge yourself into that, then your consciousness can move

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.600
into infinite realms and change its form, you see.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.320
It's interesting that the myths that your culture, not particularly the United States

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:19.320
culture, but the Earth cultures have created, some of the fantasy stories are about people

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:24.120
that transform from one shape to another, you use it from toads to princes and so forth,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:30.360
but actually this is a statement of fact, and on the higher realms it's tremendously

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.320
free and very creative to be able to change form.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.640
And one of the tremendous health of it is that one doesn't become attached in any way, you

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:46.600
see, as perhaps the physical vehicle doesn't lend into this because it seems so stable,

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.600
you know, so ongoing.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600
Does this answer your question?

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.600
No, thank you.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.600
Comments on being more open to guidance from higher forces?

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.600
No, I think that they're continuing on.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.600
Now, of course, all of the data that was given in the last two days,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:19.600
I'm sure you both heard it and you both understood instantly the thrust of the moment.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:29.200
And as with every other being who has not reached the final state of total awareness, we do

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.240
always recommend this.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.480
Both of you do it in varying degrees of efficiency at varying times of the year, at varying times

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480
of the day, and so forth.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.800
But this is very normal with fluctuation.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:49.960
But by all means, if you would like to make any change at all, or not even a change, a

00:31:49.960 --> 00:32:00.680
continuous, I would suggest a much more hopefully consistent remembrance of the moment and to

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.840
place yourself in the power of that moment.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.200
I can use the word power with you both because it is not something that you would misuse.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.400
This is not a word I would recommend you to use to your root.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.400
Power is a very loaded word in your environment.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.760
The mower itself has the power, not we.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.640
That's exactly right, sir, and that's why we can use it with you.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.280
But to other people, they translate it as something that they possess.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.280
And this makes for great misuse.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:49.280
Another question is how do any of us best discover what jobs we should be in?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.280
What kind of work we should be doing, what particular job I suppose?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.280
I think this is one of the, as I observe human life,

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.980
I would say this is one of the major questions that humans have,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.680
and very few of them think to ask about it.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.480
So I'm very pleased that this was raised,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.280
because there are a few things that can be said.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.780
Now, the first and foremost, I think,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.480
there must be an understanding within the person

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:33.080
that often time a job that they have, they look on it as something God has given them to do.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.480
Let us take an example of a clerk in a Safeway store.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.080
Now, many people, say this person is on the so-called spiritual path,

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.880
they would tend to look on that job as something God has given them, you see,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.680
and therefore they stay in it and so on.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:34:00.200
Now, this is a great misconception, because often times, you see, what the higher forces

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:07.320
want above all is for you to move with creative joy.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.640
This is one of their main aims.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:18.040
And one of the things that best helps a person in the body to have joy and creative awareness

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.840
is to having a so-called job that they enjoy doing.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:28.640
So, I would say to someone who is in a job they really don't like,

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.340
I mean, not just a marginal, if you understand,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.940
but someone who is totally unhappy in this job,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.440
the chances are, no, that they have placed themselves there on their own limitations.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.840
And if they would begin to look within themselves and ask,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.140
you know, again, we come back to the same thing.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:54.780
Most people in job situations are there because they are either comfortable or they are convenient

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.780
or they are afraid of any further expansion for fear they won't be able to handle the

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.780
new responsibilities.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.940
You see, there are many reasons.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:12.700
A fear of a decrease in income or a loss of prestige to take a job, a lesser job will

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.700
destroy their prestige.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:20.700
You see, these are all ego questions, ego attributes.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:29.700
And so the first thing that should be done is a very serious consideration, as deeply as they can,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.700
"Why am I here? Is it because I am afraid?" and so on.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.700
You know, considering all these possibilities and to look deeply at these questions,

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.700
these questions, not asking other people because other people can't answer them.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:51.060
If a woman has a prestige problem and would prefer to be in a poorly paid

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.780
prestige position, she's getting what she wants, you see. Now when the paycheck

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.700
arrives, then she's unhappy, but most of the time she's pleased because her

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:07.020
biggest desire is to be in a prestige situation. All right, so that's one type

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.020
I hope I've covered that sufficiently.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:16.940
But the first job is to look critically, to remove the veil from the real situation, your

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.340
own motivation, why you're doing what you're doing.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:26.020
If you find at the core of it that you really, the reasons that you're there are very superficial,

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:34.380
arrogant, or fearful, or egotistic, or whatever, then you're open to go to the second stage.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.680
Now the second stage is then you say, "Well, what?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.820
What in all this world would I want to do?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.780
There's so many opportunities, there's so many choices."

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.700
Well, that's really not true.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.540
If they would look at their environment, they will see that they have certain limitations

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.420
that they must work in.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.940
They have a certain amount of money they must pull in.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.580
They have a certain ability.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.500
You know, you cannot be a president of a corporation if you've never had any background.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.500
God is not interested in placing everybody in corporate positions.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.500
You see, that is not one of the...

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.500
You see, they keep placing on God functions that are not His, that He never wanted,

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.500
and has nothing to do with, you see, in a real sense.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.500
You get what you want.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.500
Believe me, the same law applies to all of the things that we've discussed.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.500
And it equally applies with your relationships, and it applies with your job,

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500
It applies in all these things.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:36.500
You're getting something that you want in any situation that you're in.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.500
So, if you discover after the self-analysis,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.500
or these people do, it doesn't really apply to you too,

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.500
but certainly to the speaker it applies to her, and to anyone else.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.500
If you really deeply look at the situation

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.500
and realize that the motives are not very exalted

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500
and you wish to move on,

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:05.500
Then the second phase is simply a constant paying attention to a movement within your life.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:12.500
Now, often times, the committee as you call them, the forces as I would call them,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:19.500
place before you like a carrot before the nose of a donkey, an opportunity.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.500
This can come in the form of something they read in the paper.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.660
the paper. I mean, we use the physical medium, you see, to teach. All of the things don't

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.820
have to come through beautiful astral nodes, sub-harmony. No. I mean, we use what is there.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:41.820
And so we use newspapers. We use other people. You know, we use the radio, the television.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.700
And if they have made up their mind that they want to make a change. Now, they don't run

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:52.700
out, quit the job, and sit around and wait for the committee to give them a new job, you

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.700
But what they do is they've made up their mind that this is what their motives are wrong.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.700
They make the best of what they're in, you see, they don't drop everything and move on.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:07.700
They make the best of what they're in, and then they keep all of their antenna out in listening.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.700
They listen within, and they listen without.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.700
They listen to people, they talk, in other words, they've decided to make a change.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.700
Now the question remains, what are they going to move into?

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:27.700
Often times a word, a neighbor said something, you know what I'm saying?

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.700
The committee places these there for you, but if you were so busy just berating and moaning and groaning

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.700
and never really being willing to make the move, then you'll never hear it.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.700
So that's the second suggestion.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:47.700
And then the third one is to, when you feel something is right, have the courage to try it.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.700
Have the courage to try it, you know?

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.700
Make an intelligent decision.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.700
You know, we are not really in favor of people leaping out of one job into another.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.700
This is usually a great waste of energy.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:06.700
But something that is considered and feels right, they will develop in their watching, you see.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.700
It all works as a whole.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.700
Their whole life.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.700
The person who will do this, what I've just described,

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:20.700
The person who is likely to respond to what we are talking about now is also the person

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:27.700
who will have response to the other data and will be in the moment with a listening antenna

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.700
out anyway.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:35.700
So they will be a test before and as they become, you see it's a matter of being confident.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:41.700
Now this is something that the divine force would like to really make clear that we are

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:47.700
We are aware that this is a confidence, you would call it faith perhaps, we call it confidence.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:54.700
Confidence that the divine really does speak to different events and you can trust it.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.700
And if they are living in the moment and paying attention, which is very high to get their attention,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.700
if they're paying attention, they will soon begin to hear things.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.700
I don't mean in mystical words, I'm speaking a very literal translation.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.700
is true, that they can also hear higher voices, yes, and they will do so as they move along.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.700
But let's just take the beginning stages here.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.700
Of the person who integrates their whole life around the idea that there is a higher wisdom

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:26.700
that can help them, that they are willing and lovingly going to surrender and submit

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.700
to and to turn their life over to it, what that means is very simply when they say, "What

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.700
do you mean?"

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.700
I know that people have asked questions often about surrender and what this means.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:44.700
And she had tremendous trouble with it when she was in a relationship with Bonnie Joseph's kid.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.700
Tremendous trouble with it was surrender, what did this mean?

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:53.700
So I think this is a good time to speak to this point so that she can better understand.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.700
I think maybe it will help in a way.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.700
I have no idea what Mr. Doe can know himself.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:06.700
I can only tell you that from our perspective, what surrender means is, first, coming to

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:15.700
the understanding that you yourself as a human entity with a limited mind and limited understanding,

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.700
that you are not capable of making the best possible choice.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:28.700
Two, having made this understanding very clear to yourself, being willing to call on a source

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.700
outside and within, you think of it as outside, absolutely, very much within yourself.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.700
Something to call on a higher force to aid you.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.700
Now, when step number two is called upon,

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.700
most of you do not believe this, and we understand that.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.700
So, where people get confused is they think that they can't move into stage two

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.700
because they don't have sufficient faith, you see, that the process will work.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.060
And we say, don't worry about that.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.860
What we want is just as much cooperation,

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.300
whatever little bits you can do, do.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.940
And we will fill in the gap.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.340
You see, it doesn't take a whole lot of moving on your part

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.340
to activate the energy on our part,

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.260
but we cannot make one move without your help.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.020
We cannot do anything until you call.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.180
Now, this is not, this is the slightest call

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.740
for you to respond.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:30.620
So I think this is an important point, that faith, this word faith, is built by observing

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.900
that it works, that the process that you have just begun is working, you see?

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.860
That then you say, "Ah, it works!

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:42.660
I called on the force, I called on the power, and it happened."

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.020
Look, it happened.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:50.060
And if you're keeping this in your awareness constantly, I think it's very helpful.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.820
It gives you faith that it would, and that's all it meant.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.940
So, that's all I have.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.300
Thank you.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.820
Another question.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.180
Are all events in your life God-sent,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:11.260
or does that only happen when one has surrendered?

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.820
Well, that too is a good question,

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.180
and it's a question I really don't really understand.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:23.180
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that a lot of people have very strange ideas about this.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.180
Um, alright.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.180
First of all, nothing happens outside of God.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.180
Alright?

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.180
Because there is nothing outside of God.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:39.180
The place where it could be stated, which is, these are bad words,

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.180
but where it could be stated that you and God separate,

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:50.180
is when you make that conscious choice to choose with the mechanism of your limited awareness.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.180
Now this is your life. This is where your free will comes in.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:02.180
You may choose to activate a life force, to activate a choice,

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:08.180
without at all worrying about whether it is in harmony with the doubt.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:17.500
So people always say how Hitler, if Hitler and God, if God is motivating Hitler and all

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.300
of the situation in Germany etc. well then what kind of a God is he?

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.940
Well the answer is simply that is not God.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.940
It happens within God, yes.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:35.660
But it is not a will of God because when God, and this is cosmological and I hope it fits

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.980
and what you're interested in, if not, is something you'll feel.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:46.460
But when the first creative impulse was with God

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.020
in the form of what you would call a human consciousness,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:57.340
the consciousness made it, out of its creation, it made its choice.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.980
Let us call it an experiment, if you will.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.220
This was not an experiment on God's part.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.220
It was a segment on the differentiated separated grill.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.220
And this is what happens now.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:15.220
[ Silence ]

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:42.220
[ Silence ]

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:57.720
[Silence]

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.220
Continuing from the other side now.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:06.220
[Silence]

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.220
It made its course.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.220
Let us call it an experiment, if you will.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:18.220
This was not an experiment on God's part. It was an experiment on this differentiated, separated will.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:26.220
And this is what happens. Now, you have tremendous trouble understanding this because it seems to you, what kind of a God is it?

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:35.220
I mean, this is why people have trouble turning to God, because they think in terms of Hitler and the tremendous chaos, etc. etc.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.020
I would like to state on behalf of the highest that I have experienced that this is not the truth

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:47.780
and if you would only learn this one lesson that you have decided, you have been given this

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.260
indivisible creative power and this is how you have chosen to use it.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:58.340
Once you change your mind, any one of you, to the slightest degree and say,

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.840
I think that I have created a devil.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.340
Look at what I've created.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.340
I choose differently.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.060
I don't want any part of this anymore.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.060
Help me.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:19.540
Then an actual movement moves into your mind and slowly and you see it is not really instantaneous

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:24.100
except for a very exalted few, you see, who are very ready.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.500
But they're not likely to be in the building that we're talking about either.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:37.180
So for most people it is a slow process of moving, inundating slowly, slowly, slowly,

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.580
slowly into the mind and making changes, a slight change here, a slight change there,

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.580
so forth.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.580
Do you understand?

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:50.900
Now, it is so sad that the great churches try so hard to reconcile the God and the devil

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:51.900
and so forth.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.540
It is very simple and I hope I made it clear to you.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.540
It's very hard to put these things in.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.540
It's a choice of a so-called separated consciousness.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.540
That's exactly right. Now that consciousness at any time can say,

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.540
"I don't want this. I want to go back to the source. That's where I want."

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.540
Now he doesn't have to go anywhere because he's never left it, you see.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.540
So it's merely a movement of going nowhere.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.540
A journey that you don't move at all.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.540
But at the same time, you see, just as you were given,

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.540
The Father has will, the Divine has will, you have will.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.540
Very simple. If you had no will, then you were not like the Father at all.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.540
You see, because you would have no will.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.540
The problem comes that we have watched this drama of humans

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.540
acting out of their own separate wills

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:49.540
and completely turning, literally turning their minds away

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.540
from the will of life, which is the will of God and harmony in the world.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:58.700
So once one decides I don't like what I have created because you have created it

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.620
Then you simply choose something different the minute you say I don't know you know

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:09.100
Speaking not to another human, but to the vast wisdom, you know, please help

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.340
Then you can say with great certainty

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.220
Everything happens by God's will

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.420
Until that time that is not a statement

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.620
It happens by your

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.780
May I?

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.780
Isn't this exactly what you're saying, as I understand it?

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:31.780
Isn't this exactly what we had in the stories of the Prodigal Son?

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.780
Oh, yes!

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.780
He was never apart from his father. He was always his father's son.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.780
But his will turned him away from his father so that he forgot it.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:48.780
And as soon as he turned back and said, "In my father's house is everything. I will to go back in his father's kingdom."

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.780
Precise.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.780
Precise.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.780
Thank you.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.780
Precise.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:53.780
There's no other meaning.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:58.780
And you notice in that story, it's the resentment of the brother that stays home.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.780
Yes.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:00.780
Yes.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.780
Right.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:07.780
Now that's really 3.2 because so many people, that brother was just as separated in his own

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.780
mind from his father as was the one.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.780
Yes.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.780
Yes.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.780
Yes.

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.780
Love you.

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.780
Thank you.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:23.780
Next question is can we be influenced by negative forces or evil forces?

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:46.780
Well, first of all, there is no organized evil. There is no devil. There is no such thing at all.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.780
That is my theory.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:52.780
Well, your theory is right because you see, all of those are separate.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:52:00.780
Now what is true is that there are entities or thought forms or clusters of thought forms

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:06.780
which have a very negative outlook

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.780
generated through various conditions that we won't go into.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.780
Now these exist both on the earth plane and the mental plane if you will,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.780
and there's every human.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:25.780
But this is really not the terrible demon that the humans make it into.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:32.780
And what really happens is, let us take, as happens often,

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:39.780
let us take a human entity who has her heart sing silently without telling anyone,

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.780
having some kind of a war within themselves between the dark and the light,

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:49.060
good thoughts and bad thoughts and you know a whole great big battle going on.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:57.980
Alright, now at some time in this battle a conscious decision, and I repeat a conscious

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:04.980
decision is made to experiment with the energies of the dark, what we would call the dark.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.980
And we'll call them.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.980
Nothing can happen that you do not call on.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:14.980
You see, the same law applies. It applies to the highest, it must apply to the lowest.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.480
You must call it on. You must call it forth, or it will not enter.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.980
And just as you cannot expect the God-force to move into you just in its own volition,

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:32.480
you must call it. By this same law, you must call on the forces of God for whatever reason.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.480
Alright?

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.980
So, this is something that they often do as an experiment.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:48.980
Now there is a tremendous attraction in some people for experiencing a dark vibration.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:57.980
It pairs with this obsessive tone quality that is different.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:58.980
Black magic to it.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:07.980
Well, it's kind of a thing. It has a vibration to it that is very stimulating to the physical body.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:12.980
You know, it's in her terminology, it's extremely general.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.980
When a lot of her life is in the emotional.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.980
Now, it is a conscious call.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.980
The problem comes when they get in the middle of the stream,

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.980
they call these God forces in, they're with feeling of a vision,

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:27.980
of the body.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:33.980
And then they start feeling their bodies getting destroyed, their minds getting very, very

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.980
chaotic, usually, which is a huge understatement.

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:42.980
And they are not always able to get out of the body.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.980
And they are not always able to get out of the body.

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:53.980
chaotic, easily, which is a very strange thing.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.980
And they are not always able,

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.980
and this is where the child is part of it, kind of,

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.980
they are not always able to then

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.980
have the awareness to call on the forces of life,

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.980
to come in and change it.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.980
Because, you see, if the balance is overreached,

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.980
even to a slight degree, and the negative is so much,

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:17.980
is in larger proportion than the dog under the light,

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.980
then of course they're not going to leave.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.980
They have feelings of their own, you see.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.980
They're not some amorphous thing that has no feelings.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:32.980
They have a movement of their own that they have established now, which is fine.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:38.980
So what can happen, and what you would call exorcism,

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:48.980
Now what happens in this case is, if enough people or even one person of sufficient strength,

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:56.980
now power is important here, you see, sufficient power of the good, can somehow be willing

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.980
to participate in a real communion with this person.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.980
I'm not speaking of a physical communion.

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.980
I'm really speaking of a mental hookup with this other person.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:18.060
And they would then move their tremendously stronger proportion of the light, which then

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:23.060
is part of this other person's now, tremendous power of light.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:27.860
And at that time, in the name of this other person and themselves, because they are one,

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:33.180
you know, we're not in separate things, this other person would then call on the light

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:38.180
and the life and movement and the beginning and the end of life.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:48.180
So, it is a very difficult thing to do.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:52.180
All of the great teachers do it constantly for their disciples,

00:56:52.180 --> 00:57:01.180
and this is how their disciples feel so much better often in the presence of a really great master.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:07.180
Because what he really is doing is moving his life into your dot, you see.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.180
He's helping, you know, get the balance going and the opposite.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:16.180
The problem is, of course, this cannot be done on a continual basis.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:21.180
You cannot just... so, it's a conscious movement on his part,

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.180
and you can't keep that up continually.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:29.180
So therefore, even if you have a quotation here on the earth,

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.180
and I think that's in...

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.180
um...

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.180
"Dream with a goal."

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.180
If you're in a physical presence, you tend to feel higher

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.180
than you do at other times, and that's fine.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.180
Now, understand that this...

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:49.180
Let us go back to this first energy restriction that called on the dark forces.

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.180
The exorcist, or whoever this is, is doing this to heal the horses.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:58:05.180
They cannot stay there, you know, they cannot continually keep in this state of communication.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:12.180
So when they withdraw, now that person is back on his own free will again.

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.180
You see, you all really must make these choices for yourself.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:21.180
No one can make these for you, otherwise free will would be a joke.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:26.980
So, but, you see, the difference now is they have another, in terminology, another chance.

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.020
They have another chance to work with it.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:34.020
This is why the way that the retainer works with it is so insane.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:36.220
[Laughter]

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:44.900
Well, this would be a little, perhaps, like helping a child to learn to walk when he takes his hand and helps,

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.460
helping to get up, but he'll never learn to walk if you don't let him go.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.460
That was different back to the African place.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:57.460
It was that whole...

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.460
So it's even been more difficult, you know, for you,

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:03.460
of taking and putting your conscience,

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:08.460
because you are aware that there is a force there,

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.460
a dark force is there.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.460
You're human beings, and you must be willing.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.460
And that is why it's so foolish for people,

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.460
without sufficient light within themselves,

00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:22.460
without sufficient understanding and power to enter into this kind of thing.

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.460
And we see it from our side constantly.

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:31.460
Very, very unprepared people are trying to move into this area

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:36.460
and what happens is that it's a trance, you see.

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.460
Example, let's go back to our first entity

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.460
who has a great deal of dark permeability,

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.660
which is a very slim opening of life.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.060
Another person comes in and enters into this

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:55.660
who themselves doesn't have as much light as their ego would imagine.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.860
Alright?

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.660
Now if those two move together

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.260
and if together the predominance is darker

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.860
then they are both in it.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.260
They both have now shared the darkness.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:06.860
You see?

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.660
And both love.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.260
They both have too much.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.260
So, I mean,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:17.780
This is another tendency probably, but it is one of the things that concerns us a lot.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:24.260
And the arrogance of certain so-called healers or so-called spiritual people who feel that

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:30.020
they can go into... you see, they half believe they can do it and they half don't, you see.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:35.340
So they go in and they are able to work this situation.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.340
It's pretty awesome.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:50.900
I don't know if it's important by asking whether you consider yourself to be a part of someone's

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:58.340
deepest subconscious or whether you feel inceptive into this reality of unconsciousness.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.540
Well, both answers are true.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:11.860
In the sense that I am a part of her consciousness is that she and I and you and your wife and

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.740
indeed all of us are a part.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.460
It is a oneness that we experience.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:25.980
In your earthly terminology, we are, I am separate from her.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:33.940
In the deepest movements of her being, we are one in the sense that she and I have shared

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.540
for eons of time a common goal.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:47.020
I have been her teacher for so long that in her awareness, she is not separate from me,

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:57.520
Just as I, in turn, am not separate from my teacher, who is a part of me in a totally integrated way.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:11.520
If you said that it's a matter of messing of vibrational waves, I would try to put this in terminology.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:19.120
It is difficult to translate this type of thing, but I will try my best.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.000
If you could envision, if you would, vast areas of light.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.400
Now, just as the prism on Earth would take a white light and reflect it out in many colors,

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:43.120
So it is in the vast region that that intensive, all-encompassing white light is also broken

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.920
down into myriad colors.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:54.680
Now as each one of those colors is broken off, there is a way of saying that those individual

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.040
colors are separate from the white light.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Do you understand?

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
Yes.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.600
Now in that sense, I could say that if we would put myself as the white light, which I do

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.800
not identify with, I do not identify myself that way, but for this analogy, if I was in

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.800
the white light, then the woman herself would be one of the colors.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.600
And in that sense, there are a lot of other colors that are closely related to her.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:32.600
You and your wife are offshoots also of her particular way of life.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.600
Do you understand?

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:41.600
All right, now, and just as I am a color to another vaster light.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:50.600
You see, this is the way this vast, beautiful thing is expressed.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.600
So, yes, in a sense, I am separate from her.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.600
In a sense, I am totally one with her.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.600
In another sense, she can never be apart from me.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.600
In another sense, she is free to think of herself as apart from me.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.600
If she chooses. This is a matter of her choice.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.600
That's really about all I can say.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:25.600
I can say these words, subconscious and so forth, really have no meaning.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600
Yeah.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:33.600
Sorry, and so I can't really speak in those terms because that is not how I experience

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
it.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
Yeah.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
If I may ask you...

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600
You know what, yes.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.600
I may ask you to do this.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.600
Have you had an earth experience in human form?

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.600
A long ago.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.600
A long ago. It has been a long time.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:59.600
And this is one of the reasons why I'm so anxious to work with this woman.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.600
Because it won't be long before she won't have to worry about that either.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:13.600
And in a sense, in a sense, these colored lights move together.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.600
Again, my terminology may be difficult, but in a sense,

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.600
when all of the colors that represent that vast ray,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:30.600
they will probably move at pretty much the same rate.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.600
These are very bad words, because we're now speaking of things that don't exist,

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.160
time and movement, in a sense, but we could be able to put it this way.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:46.160
All of the colors out of that particular prison, when they move, they will move in a certain

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160
way.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:54.160
And when their understanding is whole, when their understanding is whole, then they're

01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:02.680
free to move on into another, into another state of experience.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:08.680
And she's approaching that, as are you, as is your wife, as are the other people who

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:15.680
you perhaps sense are also part of your color scheme.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:22.680
And I'm hopeful, I'm very hopeful that this can happen for all of you.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:30.680
I'm certainly hopeful that it happens for this woman, too, because she's beginning to

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:37.680
And this is how we can tell. When they begin to sense that they don't feel the pull toward

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.680
this surface any longer, it's not a repulsion, please, I'm done. It's not a kind of pushing

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:50.680
away that we discussed. It is a dawning, I think is a very good word, a dawning of an

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:55.680
of an awareness that there is a much vaster world,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.680
in close world, to experience.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.680
And this is what she's working for.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.680
Yes, I have to answer your question.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.680
Yes, I have been on the Earth before.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.680
I have actually been with you, so before not with your wife.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:18.680
But your wife has a very close connection with someone who I am very closely connected with.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.680
So in a sense, it's all one.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:33.680
And it was many years ago, and if she knows, she has in fact experienced a part of that

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:40.680
life through one of the sessions, which was a session that I felt we were ready then to

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.680
really communicate.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:50.080
communicate. If you recall, we had a session with her in which she was in a cave-like state

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:56.760
and we were speaking and she was speaking to one of the brothers. Now that was not myself

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:02.120
but it was at that particular time of her incarnated pattern that I was also in her life

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:08.360
therefore I could use that as the time, you understand, I could use that because the reference

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.360
point was there for me, so I believe that.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:18.360
It's not the figure that's really speaking to me, but I was able to use that.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Yes.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.360
Now, perhaps there's something for a question in Chicago.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:32.360
We have been receiving rather intensively the question, "What can you do?"

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360
sometimes, "Who am I?"

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:41.360
And, uh, could you give something on that line that would be helpful in your understanding?

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:49.360
Well, first, I think that both statements are valid and both statements are helpful.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:56.360
To some, the question "Who am I?" is much more meaningful than "What am I?"

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:04.900
So I think a great deal of looseness in these terms is excellent, that you and your wife

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900
both survive.

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:15.920
And I think that if you could give them the hardest part, the very hardest part, for the

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:23.760
humans who identify so strongly with the physical body, the hardest part of this learning process

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.760
and I'm going to get the sense of a not now.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:34.760
Now, by that I mean,

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:41.760
they tend to think in terms of now as something very substantial and very concrete.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.760
Now is now. It is the same.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.760
Now, the "who am I?" question

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.760
is not to be addressed to that concreteness.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.760
You see, the question, the image, perhaps, that might be helpful for some of them,

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.760
as they see this pool or this flat,

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.760
it is to present the question

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.760
and then allow no answer to arise at all.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.760
No idea, no concrete thought,

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:25.520
Nothing it is that nothing that they it is done. This is so difficult. It is a nothing area that they must

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:35.000
Immerse themselves in and it is it can be some of those people in your group. It can be a real immersion

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.080
in fact interesting enough one of the early derivations of the

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.180
That presents one when one was baptized in and immersed in the river

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.680
in the water this is the this is a

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.600
man symbolic

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.640
yearning to

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.840
immerse himself totally in this in this flow of nothing

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:11.000
Then it becomes very important like a symbol, but if they can grasp that it is the vast

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.720
no place that is their home.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:22.720
And the way that they can easily, I would feel,

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.720
so this particular group, is in their sitting time,

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.720
if they can search, a very strange way to put it,

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.720
to search for what isn't there,

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.720
to become very attentive and attuned

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.840
and tuning for feeling and listening for what isn't there.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.020
They will understand that as they start working with it

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.240
because you see if something arises well they'll say

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.680
well this is here it's not that and so it becomes a nothingness

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.160
not this not this and this and this.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.520
But eventually when they become accustomed to this

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.480
they will very easily be able to then as they're walking

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.040
or driving or sitting or whatever they will be able to

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.200
fall into the nowhere.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:19.280
And as they become more accustomed to that,

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.440
they will be much more able to do it

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.360
in the various movements of their lifestyle.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.560
And if I may just start with you.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.120
I'll just...

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.520
I begin, of course, with a very warm,

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.880
warm welcome to them all.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.880
And, um,

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.480
so you didn't need to really tell us that you had a group

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.680
because we have been very aware of this for a long time

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.480
and have been doing from our side what we could.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.480
Um, the situation, the difficulty with the group, of course,

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.480
is its fluctuating participation.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:09.480
It is difficult for us on our side

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:16.560
to apply the necessary energies at the necessary time

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.800
that would help, say, one of the older,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.640
not in terms of years, but in terms of time in the group,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.520
some of those people have been with you a long time.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:35.520
we have been trying to reach them with greater areas of awareness for quite some time.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:42.000
The problem comes when we cannot always do that in a...

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
when the people are changing and new people are coming in

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.280
who often times have very deep understanding

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.480
but not necessarily in the same line that you've been developing.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.560
Do you understand?

01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:01.560
So you are always in a situation, you as the guide of this group, and of course your wife,

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:11.880
to, it is difficult to keep a flow going in a progressively deeper level of understanding,

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.600
which is how we best like to work in a group situation.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:23.560
Now what are you to do, because this is the nature of this particular group?

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.120
There's nothing you can do and we are aware of this. We have been trying

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.520
to impress on various team members of the group. There are

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.400
seven team members who form the core

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:46.880
of the group and it is these seven members that we have been working on

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.840
deeper levels with in various ways, opening up other channels,

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.840
Opening up new avenues that they might explore some of which don't work out for them others

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.280
do so

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.040
Primarily the the group that you've been working with

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.480
Come together now. They are not necessarily aware of this connection these seven people

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.200
Could we have a cover?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.720
That they're not necessarily aware of their interconnectedness

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.320
But we are and when they do come together

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.400
in the meditation time

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:33.920
If I may put it this way certain information is passed out among them

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:41.920
The the one thing that perhaps you might think about changing

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.760
Is so many of them are floating

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880
on a very thin membrane

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.880
Between the deeper realms of

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.160
the world the deepest parts of their being and

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.960
the less

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.440
Enlightened parts of their being it is almost as if they're riding

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.760
on the skin of the sea

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:19.280
And they're seeking to break through that skin down into the depth and begin a serious depth

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.020
Maneuver, do you understand the imagery yet? Now your job sir if you

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:31.700
Really choose to continue it and it has always been your job and your wife's job

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:38.940
Is to help them to break that skin of the seed open now

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.260
The one thing that we might suggest that has not really been emphasized

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.840
enough perhaps from our perception

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.200
is

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.760
deeper

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.760
meditation for them because

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:01.680
Many of them live extremely busy lives and are trying to solve things on the exterior level

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.800
and their their real depth will not be touched until they break this membrane and

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:17.660
And it can be done, but they must apply the knife of meditation.

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.960
However they choose.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.960
Now you have a very composite group, you know, they do many different things.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:37.160
And that is fine. They should be encouraged to pursue in-depth meditation in whatever field they feel.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.880
for example, one I feel very strongly,

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.760
one of you people would definitely benefit

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:51.160
by the book that this woman brought today for your wife to read.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.160
One of your students will be drawn to that book

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.560
and should pursue that line.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:04.360
Now, many of them are not drawn toward the Buddhist way of thinking.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.360
that doesn't necessarily matter

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360
you're referring to both the healthy and the unhealthy?

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360
yes, yes, yes

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.360
one particularly will find it extremely helpful

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.360
others, peripherally, will find benefit perhaps

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
but there is one particular person

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.360
but in any case

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.360
the job is to

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:32.360
not to decide which one form of meditation is going to be used to break through

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:41.880
through but simply to begin a program of them finding out their own way. You see, lying

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:49.240
within them in an embryo state of all of these very, very beautiful people, really beautiful

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:56.640
bunch of people, lying so close to their heart is their own way, the way that will take them

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:07.280
to the light and if the thrust for the new year could be an in-depth awareness of coming to

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:15.000
find their own way, which will be intensely difficult because you see everyone will tend

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.560
to look perhaps to you and your wife, well how do they do it, but your way is not their

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:26.480
way sir and one of the group members for example I feel will find a very

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:34.120
independent almost what should we call far out way but it will be that person's

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:40.400
way and it could be it should be taken seriously if you could you and your

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:53.280
could somehow instigate an intensive search within for them to bring to their

01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:00.320
conscious mind the symbols that are meaningful to them and meditate upon

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.080
these symbols. I'm being very specific sir because there are symbols, actual

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:16.320
visual symbols that lie within each person which is medicated upon will open

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:24.120
the door that stands behind the world that you know it. Now in one person's

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.600
case the cross will be the symbol I see it clearly. Now this is not true in the

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.000
other people's case but this person in order to have this symbol become

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
meaningful, you must discover it anew. It's a woman and she will find it on her own, you

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.080
see, and it will be just like, it will just be like finding the holy grail before your

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:53.080
eyes. It will be so meaningful and that symbol will flow with her day and night because you

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:59.640
see, once we come in contact with our own symbol, that one symbol that is all meaningful

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:06.240
to us, then our life begins to change. It takes on a totally different feeling. It becomes

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:12.600
full and creative and light and meaningful only because we've come in touch with that

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:20.000
symbol. Now, in some people's case, the symbol will be perhaps more nebulous. It will be

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:30.000
perhaps a symbol of compassion. Now that is a symbol. Compassion, sir, is really a symbol.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And when I say compassion to you, sir, it means one thing. When I say it to someone

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
in your group, it means something entirely different. That is the kind of thing that

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.000
one must think. When one says God, now to you that has one meaning. I assume, sir, if

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
If you say God to the people in your group, it means very many different things.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And as they come in contact with what does that say to me, not what does that think to me.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You understand?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
It doesn't matter what their think is.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
What matters is what does that bring up.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000
What is there that rises up that covers them in a feeling of security?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:19.240
You see, so many of these people are not secure in the world,

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:23.520
but many of them have had extremely difficult lives,

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.840
a great deal of pain and sorrow and loss and confusion

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.600
and heartbreak.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.880
You know, it's not-- because some of them are older,

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.880
you see, they have had time to be, shall we say, processed.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.640
And this is a difficult thing.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:47.000
And coming in contact with these symbols that align right under the skin of the sea that

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.200
we're speaking of, it will give them the feeling that they're seeking outside, which is really

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.000
never to be found.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:05.720
It will give them the peace and the protection and that total relief, the total belief in

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:14.840
the light because as they take these symbols and make their whole life a meaningful remembrance

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:22.480
of the symbol, they will change. Everything will change. You know, the very things in

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.680
the room will begin to change for them. So this has happened to you, so you do know what

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:33.200
I speak, but I will repeat it for the sake of this tape because some of them maybe have

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:40.100
not explain this. In looking at a rose, for example, when one has moved into the flow

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:48.100
of one's own symbol, that rose is totally transformed. It becomes all of life. Life

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:55.100
itself in its totality is then revealed in that one rose. And this is the kind of thing

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.560
that we would wish for the people we know in this group. And so many of them are so

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.560
close to that and it's almost as if they need to just rip apart the skin and

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.680
allow themselves the glory of the light that is so close because so many

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:19.080
of them are so close. Oh my heart fills with love as I you know my mind

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.760
touches on the various members of your group and the capabilities are

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:32.160
unbounded, unbounded. It has nothing to do with their verbal abilities, because verbal

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:40.480
abilities have nothing to do with spiritual awareness. And so if you and your wife could

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:50.520
in any way help them in a rather definite form, so you're not very definite in your

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.740
form in this course, you see, you're very open and that is a beautiful thing. But in

01:24:55.740 --> 01:25:05.240
perhaps just for the sake of these, say, six-month period if you would give it a try, to have

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:12.900
a course of action, of inward action to, you've read so many things, you've been in touch with

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:20.620
so much that you could do this, set a certain format that you think would be helpful. Perhaps

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.620
this new book that has come to you from...

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620
from...

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620
- I believe me.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.620
- Yes.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.620
If you could perhaps use that as a format.

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.620
I'm not giving that as the only example,

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:35.620
but some definite form

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.620
so that they will keep working on it,

01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:41.620
have a way of gnawing at the bone,

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.620
if you will,

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.620
to pull aside the veil.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.620
And the light will show itself

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:52.720
at different times for each of them in different ways but this would be a

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.900
tremendous help to them if you could give some thought to that. Yes I'd appreciate that.

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:04.020
If there are any other suggestions as to techniques as to how to go about it I'd appreciate that.

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:12.460
Well they must learn to write things down. So many of the humans find it a

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:18.440
boring tiresome thing but in the beginning stages there is necessary to

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:24.360
get it down on paper for example if you were to have a meditation session

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.820
assignment a very bad word I realize but if you could perhaps as an experiment

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:36.640
have an assignment you see if you give an assignment each week this gives a

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.060
cohesive movement to the group and even though someone new comes in the second

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:47.700
week, it won't matter because you see the people will have had a building process going on

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:59.420
and address a deep spiritual meaningful question for them to meditate upon that week.

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:06.780
For example, it comes to the heart that one could perhaps say, "What do you look on as

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:13.340
the most sacred of all the symbols that your mind can think of.

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:18.140
That will give them the opportunity of going through all week, how many symbols are there?

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.300
There are millions of symbols.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:28.140
But you see, each one will be drawn automatically toward the one that is really meaningful to

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:29.140
them.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:35.740
You will find that some of them will come to this awareness superficially, and they will

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:41.180
say, "Well, this is my symbol," and within two or three weeks it will dissipate, you

01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.900
see, because their mind will have told them that this was a symbol to work with,

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.900
whereas actually it was something they had read, perhaps, you see, or they have a

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.180
friend or an uncle or someone who had gotten meaning out of a particular

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.220
symbol. It will not be their own, but that's all right. That's all right. The

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:06.220
process is one of uncovering. So, address this problem directly, perhaps. This is simply

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:14.100
suggesting. This directs a direct question. During this week, cast into your mind and

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:20.740
into your heart, because symbols are found in both places. The heart has its own symbol.

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:27.620
The mind has its own symbol. There are different symbols, you see, because they're different,

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:31.940
I hate to use these words. People become so trapped in them. There are certain levels,

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:38.180
a very bad choice of words, but if you will bear with me. There are certain symbols that relate to

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:44.180
the level of the heart. There are certain symbols that relate to the level of the mind, and there

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:51.460
are certain symbols that transcend both. But each will find their own place. So a beginning subject

01:28:51.460 --> 01:29:00.260
of that, and then after they have perhaps gotten in touch with that, then the following week,

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:07.340
perhaps for those, some of them are very beautifully artistically inclined, visualizing on a paper

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.780
an actual drawing of it.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:16.780
What we're trying to do, sir, is to bring it as a living...

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.780
(coughs)

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:27.780
Excuse me, I'm running a bit.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.780
Please excuse this.

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:37.780
The woman would be very embarrassed if she knew.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:48.780
We are trying to bring these symbols in as a living, creative, totally meaningful symbol of the all.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.780
And it can be easily worked on this level.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:59.780
And many of you people are very inclined toward this kind of thing, toward the drawing of it, the embellishing of it in any way.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.780
Now, sir, this would not be meaningful to you.

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.780
This is not a way you would have selected.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:08.660
but the particular people who are in your group

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:12.620
I think will respond to this

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:17.300
and the ones that don't wish to visualize it as in

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:22.220
on paper for example the ones that have a more abstract

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:25.500
symbol that comes to them that is no less valid

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:30.140
a symbol that is not terribly abstract is no less valid as I know you know

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:33.960
so you are a perfect person actually you and your wife

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:38.400
are perfect people to enjoin on this kind of a thing

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.520
because you don't have any of these very rigid ideas

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.160
of what will be acceptable and what will not

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.960
and let them go, let them find their way

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.520
and they will, some of them very quickly

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.960
some of them very quickly and it will become

01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:01.560
if you will, a focus for their movement into the deeper states of meditation

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:07.480
I do feel, sir, that there are many of them who are very ready for some deep states of

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.480
meditation.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:14.160
And you've read much on the subject.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:21.920
And also, please be aware that we are constantly placing in your hands data that we hope you

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920
will use.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:29.560
You see, since you are an open channel, we are able to use you.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.560
I hope you understand the meaning and the positive sense.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:38.560
In the sense that we will give data to you through various written materials and so forth,

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.560
that we in turn hope you will incorporate in your group, which you do.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:51.560
The one thing that we would ask is that there be perhaps less now of a mental discussion of things

01:31:51.560 --> 01:32:00.720
of things and now move into the more difficult yet the more meaningful areas of bringing

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:07.720
out the deep symbology and deep light that lies in all of these people.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:14.720
[silence]

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:24.720
[BLANK_AUDIO]

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:34.720
[BLANK_AUDIO]

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:39.720
[silence]

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:59.720
[silence]

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:11.700
[ Silence ]
