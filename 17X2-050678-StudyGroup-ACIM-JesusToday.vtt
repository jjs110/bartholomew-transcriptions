WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
Yes. First I would like to ask for some insight from your perspective on our

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.200
relationship with our friend Alice.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:24.600
Well this is a difficult relationship in the terminology of the world that has

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.600
come home to roost, I believe is the term used here.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.600
Make no mistakes, this is an old, an old relationship.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
More in relationship to your wife really than to yourself,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.600
but nevertheless, in periphery part for you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
I believe I will address most of this to your wife

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
since she does seem to be the focal point of most of it.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.600
Do you want to sit over here?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
If you don't mind, it's easier for me.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:08.600
The first thing that we would really like to tell you is that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.600
although the circumstances may be extremely difficult for you on the physical plane,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.600
there is a debt here of tremendous importance.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Your connection with her is old, has not been very important in this lifetime at all,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.600
but nevertheless carries a very strong impression from two lifetimes ago.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.600
This is a carryover, of course, that has faded out of your consciousness and also out of hers.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.600
The reason that she is here in this particular relationship

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.600
is to enable you to repay this small debt that has been left over.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
[cough]

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.600
The main thing is to remember that it will not be of a very long-lasting nature.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.600
She will not be in relationship to you in this way for very much longer.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
But make good use of it, if you would, while she's here,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400
while she's here because there are some important lessons.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400
First of all, the most important thing that we would ask you to remember

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.100
is that there is nothing you can do for her.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.300
Thank you.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.000
Well, this is...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.900
Because of your awareness of freedom that can exist on the earth plane

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
within one's mind if one's mind has light in it,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.000
you feel that you would like to in some way transfer this wisdom to her

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so that you may help her.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500
One hates to give up on anyone,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.500
but please rest assured

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
that experts have tried in this field and have failed.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.000
She has been given many, many opportunities

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.500
to lighten her load, literally to lighten it,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
to bring light to herself, to her load.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
She has, within her conscious memory in this lifetime,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
many, many references of various religions and text work

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.840
that would, if she would become deeply concentrated on it,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.500
would tremendously lighten her life.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.240
But each time she has chosen to remain as she is.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.500
So please, first and foremost,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
do not feel at all responsible for transforming any of this, please.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.500
All right?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.000
And don't even make a terribly great effort

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.740
to incorporate her into your group

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.000
or to make any special efforts along that line.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In a sense, we're dealing with a spoiled child who has for many years been allowed to be spoiled

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and continues it in this later advanced years.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But don't be overly concerned and when you're there,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
our concern mostly is that she will try to somehow bleed from you.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
This is a term that we use, I don't know how it translates through for you.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
A bleeding of an energy field from one person to another is a very common thing on the earth plane that is not always observed by the humans.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You mean, excuse me, that she would drain energy from me?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes, and now this takes many forms. It's not just a matter of as you sit there that she will somehow remove it from you.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
It usually will come in the terms of wanting you to do extra extraneous things for her.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In other words, you using your energy for her rather than first her doing it herself.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now many things that other people perform for this woman she could do for herself.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and it is a way of her becoming center stage, you see.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And that's all a very childish response to this situation.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And really, if you can get it out of your mind

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that you're dealing with an adult, I think you will do better.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Just look on her with a tender-hearted concern

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
as you would of a child who has not yet reached the state of maturity.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The sad thing, of course, is that she will cross over

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and will still be in this state and then we'll have much to do,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but that is really not your concern, you see.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So our worry is, do not allow her to misuse your energy and your time,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because it is not as if you were helping her to be more positive.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Do what you feel is vital and is loving and is necessary,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but please be well aware that there is a childish resentment in her

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
against any field of love for anyone else that you may have.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And this includes your husband.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
She resents the time and the ties that you have built up with him.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
She will resent very much knowing, for example, when your family is here,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
this will be another time that she will have difficulties.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
These patterns will, you know, repeat themselves with anyone who is close to you.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But just as you would not indulge a child, as you would just be firm and loving,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we would request that you consider this approach to her.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
One, you cannot really help her, so please don't make overly conscientious efforts along that line.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And two, really stand removed.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
There is on the earth plane at this time a lot of children

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[cough]

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
a lot of children who are called

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I cannot remember the term

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I'm sorry

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It is, it is, the way it is seen for us is they are overly active

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
much too tension ridden

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Hyperactive children?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Yes

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Now, and there are many more of them on the earth plane at this time than there ever have been

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and this is an interesting question that no one seems to have asked yet as to why.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Well, this woman should be considered as one of these.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
She will make excessive demands, she will be very arbitrary,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
she will be very full of temper and tantrums in a sense.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And just treat it as you would one of these children.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Have you anything else you'd like to add?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Yes, just one more question. You mentioned that I had a debt that I owe to her. Is there anything else, what type of a debt, or what I, anything else which I need to do for her, even though I can't help her with her understanding? Is there any other debt here that I need to...

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Well, it is a small matter in terms of, in the two lifetimes ago that I spoke of, there was an opportunity.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
When you were less developed two lifetimes ago, you have come a great deal in your two lifetimes.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And two lifetimes ago, there was an opportunity for you to help her in a physical manner, on a physical plane,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
simply in a physical way, and you turned on it and didn't.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and it's simply that, it's nothing terribly complicated or terribly...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it's certainly nothing other than that, it's simply you have the opportunity,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
you have chosen to play it out at this time and to end your responsibility

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and to, as it were, clean up the slate and that's all that this is.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Well, I guess what I'm asking then is just the fact that I run in and out

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and check and make sure that she's alright, that she has food

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
food or if she has her needs taken care of, that takes care of it?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
That does take care of it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Thank you so much.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.280
There is no need and you must please stay free from any concern.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.800
The moment she really wants help, there is so much crowding within her home that is waiting

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.680
to assist her.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680
So we simply wait for her choice.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.680
Thank you.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.680
for her choice.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.680
Thank you.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:19.680
We have been considering starting what we might call a core group

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680
from some of those who have been with us in our quest group for a period of time,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:32.680
going into some deeper truths that are less possible in the fluctuating group

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.480
as a quest group, and I would like any suggestions you might have

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.480
for the functioning of this group and perhaps the individuals

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.480
that might be, benefit the most from it.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.480
Well, I think it's a wonderful idea, and I'm so glad you picked it up,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.480
because it is something that we have been suggesting in various ways to you for quite a while,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:06.480
and we're very pleased that you have received this message

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.280
because this is indeed what is needed

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.880
because your group does function on two levels

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.780
and there are those who are very much ready for a deeper group.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.180
Now, there is one problem you will have to face.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.980
The ones who do not...

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.880
The problem that you will face is how to get the core group to function

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.480
without making the others feel in any way left out.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:42.600
Now, I think that one of the ways to avoid this obvious problem

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:50.200
is if you announce that you are going to start a very serious study group

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.320
and that it will involve a degree of commitment,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.320
that certain ones of them will eliminate themselves automatically.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.320
Do you understand what I mean?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.320
But some of them will say, "Well, obviously I don't have the time, I don't have the interest," and so forth.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320
But they will be eliminated.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.320
But then there will be others who will be drawn,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.320
who will not really be as committed as they think they are,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.320
but for a social reason or for their own ego or for whatever reason,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.320
will then be drawn to coming.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.320
I would not be overly concerned about them,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320
because one of two things will happen.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.320
They will either become very serious, which is of course what you would hope for,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:37.320
that through the deeper studying that they are into, this will then bring forward the very thing that you're trying for,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:45.320
or they will find of themselves that they are either bored or can't find the time, or will weed themselves out of your situation.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:52.320
Don't be overly concerned, but I think your presentation must be very strong, that this is a disciplined order.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:12:00.320
You see, there will be a set text even, so much as a beginning text.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.320
Do you see what I'm saying? It must be structured in a very disciplined manner.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:13.320
There should be required times of meditation for them, whatever you choose to set up.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.320
But there must be a commitment on their part prior to joining it.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.320
if you could present it as sort of an experiment, if you will,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.320
you know, that you would like to experiment on whether certain things are beneficial or not

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320
and you would like a certain core group to work with you.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.320
Now, if everyone in your group volunteers, then you will have a difficult problem

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.320
and you may have to drop the project. Do you see?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320
Yes.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.320
If the night that you announce it, they all say, "Fine, let us turn this night into that serious study,"

00:12:46.320 --> 00:13:02.320
Then you will have to think about that. Then you may have to impose those rules right then and say that this is a requirement and that henceforth anyone who comes on that particular night will have to fulfill these requirements. Do you see?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.320
No, we're making it an afternoon meeting for that reason, partly.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:20.320
Well, my point is this. If on your night of your meeting you announce this, everyone will say, "Well, that's why we're here. That's why we're sitting here. That's just what we want."

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:32.320
Now this will then give you pause, and you may then have to say, "All right, then let us turn this into a definite group meeting with definite structures."

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.320
you see, the rules that would have applied to your afternoon meeting will now have to be applied to your evening meeting

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.320
and then you'll have to see how it works out.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.320
You see, embryo things like this move in different directions and often surprise you.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.320
And you may get a lot of the people that come in the evening will simply not come anymore

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.320
because it's too intense, they don't get to talk enough, they have to do too much meditation,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.720
things are too deep or you see, they will weed themselves out.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.720
So one of two things can happen.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.720
I think you would do best if you would keep an open mind

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.720
and as you presented to say,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.720
we would like to have a very serious core group

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720
that will go into deeper areas of these subject fields

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.720
and I would appreciate it if those of you who are interested

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.240
interested will contact me at a later time, all right? Because this then removes

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.240
that spontaneous combustion of everyone saying, "Oh, now, now, I want it, you see, to

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.600
say please contact me at a later time." That in itself will weed out a lot of

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.360
the people who will not take the time to telephone, to set up an appointment, to

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.200
come and see you. And I think that you should both be very serious about that

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.200
first meeting when they come, each one comes on their own to you, to really

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.200
work with them as to whether it is something they really want. In other

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.700
words, to have a certain standard that you will set and then ask them if this is

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.600
really what they're looking for. Sort of like you have an opening in a job, you

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.900
know, you have to present your desires and what you want in the group

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.400
and then see if that person who is sitting there will be able to fulfill that or who even wants to.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.400
You must be sober about it, is my meaning.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.400
Otherwise, you are going to have the same pattern repeating.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.900
Only your afternoon group will be filled with people who don't work and who don't want to go to the supermarket, you see.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.400
So, much of it depends on your seriousness

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.400
and please, as much as you can, put aside all preconceived ideas of who should belong

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.400
Because you may be surprised.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.400
May I ask a question?

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400
Certainly.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.400
Do I understand you correctly that when we announce this meeting

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.400
and then when we set a time that they come,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:12.400
we should have a program laid out, say,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.400
if we would work it out between ourselves,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.400
that we're going to study such and such a book

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.120
book or are we going to spend this much time in meditation and that kind of thing to have

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.840
a program laid out that we present to them?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.040
Is that what you mean?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.640
My thought was this.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.840
The evening comes and you announce that you are going to, do not say you are thinking

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:42.640
of, just state you are going to start a core group and anyone who is interested, please

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.760
contact you by phone at a later date and you will set up with each person

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.560
individually a time when they come to your home and discuss with you whether

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:01.040
they would really want to participate in this. Do you see? And then each one will

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.120
come at a separate time. Oh. Not having four people come at once. I see. Because

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.480
you see what you really want is the first of all the person who cares enough

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.440
to make the phone call, the person who cares enough to set up the interview, the

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.000
the person who cares enough to give thought to what you present.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.500
Now when each one of them individually comes and speaks to you,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.100
that is when you should say this is a rigorous program,

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.760
this is what we have in mind,

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.200
we are going to have these as our certain criteria

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.000
and we really want this to be a much more intense and serious situation.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.160
Now, many of the egos will respond yes, yes,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.680
but in actuality many of them will probably drop out

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:45.180
because they will not be able to prove themselves about how rigorous they're being

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:55.180
and I think it would be important, very important, that there be a knowledge in them

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:02.180
that if they do take this on, that they will really give themselves to it for a certain period of time

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.180
as an experimental group

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:15.180
But again I say you should be serious about this and the reason I say that is that you sir tend to be a little tenuous about things like this you see you are a little tenuous

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:24.180
and that is not really that that makes them tenuous well if I do the work that's alright but if I don't well then that's alright this kind of thing

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.180
so if you could be a little more sober about that

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:35.180
Thank you. The next point that I wanted to ask about, Arnold Teunby, the historian, made

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:48.820
a statement recently that, as he saw, one of the most important events in this era was the

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:55.820
interpenetration of Christianity by Buddhism. Do you have any comments on that?

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:05.820
The movement of the world, the movement of all of the forces on the earth plane is toward a oneness.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:15.820
The statement that he is making comes from his bias and should be understood as such.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:36.820
But what is represented in the truth of all that kind of statements is that the aim of those of us that stand on the other side of the light is to pierce the mind of man with the knowledge that the energy from which each varying religion derives its meaning comes from one source.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:44.380
and any inner penetration is only successful to the extent that each of those two entities

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.740
come to see their deep similarity of source.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:53.860
It would be a same truth in the statement to say that Mohammedanism and Christianity coming

00:19:53.860 --> 00:20:00.060
together would be an important event or the religion of Islam, whatever, because what

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:07.540
What is really the thrust of our work is for all to see that there is one source, there

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:14.860
is one source, and any movement that can be made on the earth plane for peoples to blend

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:21.020
their varying dichotomies together into an awareness that there is only one source from

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.020
which they spring.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:30.020
That is a very monumental movement on the part of the human entity.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:37.020
So, there's not anything particularly special about Buddhism and Christianity meeting.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.020
The only time that it will be at all special is if, as a result,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.020
if these two different feelings, these two different strains,

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:56.520
can blend together to the point where they recognize their one basic source from which they spring,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.720
then it will have been a successful experiment.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.020
It is by no means a completed fact.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.020
No, of course not.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.520
By no means.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:10.520
And in fact, there is jeopardy, because it could set many people up in opposition, you see.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.020
Any kind of a force like this also creates an opposite force,

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:21.540
and some of that opposite force is taking a great deal of manifestation in the Christian

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.500
world where they are becoming, if I may say, bull-headed about this.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:34.340
You see, they are, it's almost a backlash of isolation.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.900
The Christian movement is becoming perhaps even more isolated in a sense, a certain strain

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.900
of it as a result of what they consider to be the threat of this Buddhist philosophy.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:53.420
But the basic important thing for all concerned from our perception, the basic thing that

00:21:53.420 --> 00:22:00.420
they need to see is to drop all of the extraneous things that are not the same. For example,

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.980
the enlightened Buddhist or the enlightened Christian would tell you that the understanding

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.480
of Christ and the Buddha are very similar.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.280
They are very similar.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.580
There are certain areas in course where they differ

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.480
because of many obvious things.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.780
But the truth, the heart of both of these

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.380
be with truth.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.480
And this is what is hoped.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.280
This is what is hoped, you see.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.780
Now, it may not be successful.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.480
It may not work.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.780
You implied one time that that was part of my function

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.620
at this time was to promote this sort of thing.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.940
Yes, this is still true.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.940
And the reason that you are helpful in this regard

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.580
is that you are able to also see the truth that lies in Christianity.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.340
You see, it is not very helpful to have a lot of people biased,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.940
a lot of Christians saying that their way is the only way,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.460
and a lot of Buddhists, which they also say,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.380
that their way is the only way.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.260
We observe a very interesting thing.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:09.260
The Hindu, for example, says that he is willing to honor other gods and so forth.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:15.260
That in fact, if you wish to take each individual Hindu, you see,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.260
and ask that particular Hindu his particular deep belief,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.260
what he will tell you is that his particular deity is the strongest, you see.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.260
There really is very little...

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.260
A Buddhist, for example, is very willing to say, yes, Christianity can be accepted and so forth.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:39.260
But if you take a particular Buddhist and speak to him clearly, what he says is, Buddha is the way.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.260
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:50.260
That although the theology of these various religions gives approval of other religions,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.020
religions in the heart of the person who is doing the worshipping there is a feeling of

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:03.020
superiority over other religions. And this is what we want so much to see breaking down

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:09.860
if we can. And the reason that you will be helpful, you will be helpful to the extent

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:15.420
that you can see the Christ heart beating within the Buddhist heart and realizing that

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.420
that they both beat with the same pulse because it is the pulse of God.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:27.420
You see, they tend to forget that it is God that is the source from which all of these,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.420
the Christ and the Buddha spring, you see,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:41.420
and the emphasis must go back to the source and to the similarities instead of to the dissimilarities.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.420
Yes.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.420
It was once you made a statement about reincarnation,

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.420
and it seemed to me that you viewed the subject from a different perspective

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.420
from the usual one that we have here on this planet.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.420
Would you help us with your insight on this process?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:14.420
Well, incarnation, reincarnation, the whole subject is very muddled.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:26.420
The reason for this is of course the ego's tremendous desire to feel that it will live on forever.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:34.420
And therefore it tries very hard to keep its life pulse beating throughout eternity.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:41.420
Therefore you have many of the doctrines that say that one life follows another and so forth.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:49.420
What I am going to say will probably not please many of you, or maybe any of you.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:26:04.100
But what is true is that your life, as each one of you individually live it, is not as

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:13.420
separate from other people's lives as your perception would lend you to think.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:21.220
For example, in the case of you and your wife, you've spent many years together.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:29.820
You might perceive your life as your own entity moving through certain steps, affected by your

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.820
past actions.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.820
This is a typical view of reincarnation.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:40.440
Now, that is partially true, but it is partially not true, because the fact is that if you could

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:46.760
perceive with the inner eye rather than just the eyes of the body, you would perceive that

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.560
the body of you and your wife, there is no difference. You see, if you could see this

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:59.440
room now and could see the perception of the movements, the undulating movements of lights

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.160
that move between these four bodies, you would laugh at this idea of your tremendous separateness

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.320
because you are not separate. You see, a thought comes from that gentleman there over this

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:17.320
way and its movement blends with what is happening here and changes it. There is not this tremendous

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.680
wall that separates each one and this is why the great teachers have emphasized over and

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:30.680
over and over again when you begin the movement toward awareness of the light, of the God

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.000
Self, of the Christ, of the Buddha, whatever, when you begin this movement, the reason they

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.560
asked you to be selective about who you're with is because of this very phenomenon of

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:49.040
which I'm speaking. It is not some kind of a prudish, specialistic idea. It is simply

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.840
a truth that you blend and the ones that are closest to you in physical form are the ones

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.440
you blend the easiest with. This makes good sense to you, I hope. So therefore, this is

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.040
why we have a concern about this gentleman and his job that he is chosen.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.040
Do you hear me sir?

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040
I certainly do.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:14.040
Because he also is not separate from all of the movements that are happening out where he is located.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:21.440
And although we have done our best to protect him with a shield of light,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.640
there is only so much that one can do when a person is placed in that environment.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:32.140
The reason that he will move out of his location is simply that as he becomes more purified,

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.140
as his consciousness becomes more and more attuned,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.640
it will be increasingly, instead of being easier to be there, it will be more difficult to be there.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.640
Because there will be this continual mingling. Do you see what I'm saying?

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:53.640
That their consciousness of those entities is on a lower plane at this time

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:59.000
and is unfortunately kept isolated because that's almost all they have

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.200
and they draw onto them people who they call guards

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.040
whose consciousness are very similar.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.760
Now the exceptions are in the teaching staff

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.920
and various other pinpoints of light that I perceive now in that building.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.360
There are some pinpoints of light.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.440
The teaching end of the building has this.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.120
But if you understand me, sir,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.120
This is one of the reasons why you may find yourself moving out of that.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120
I understand.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:34.120
Now, back to the reincarnation. It is very, very funny for us to view all of you

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:42.120
feeling that your little life is so special and so separate and so very independent from our perception.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.120
Please be glad that this is not so, because if this were true,

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.120
it would be extremely difficult for you to transcend.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:30:02.120
extremely, because you see, if you were independent one from another, you would also be independent from the source of the good ones, from the source of the great ones that stand there, you see.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:14.120
You cannot be isolated only from other people and also then be open to the vast wisdom of the great ones that stand there, you see.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.120
So be grateful, please, that it's been set up in this manner.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.120
It is much more wonderful, if you can get your minds to turn a slight degree,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:29.120
so much more wonderful to realize that as the four of these bodies sit in this room,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:38.120
that what they all are is just melding and merging and doing in many ways a lovely rhythm, you see.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.620
And this is why the environment in which you live speaks importantly to you also.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:50.620
You know, if you live in a very dark hovel, there is something within that dark hovel

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.620
that can press upon you and you will become a part of that,

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.120
because you see, you are a part of this.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.620
You are a part of this.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.120
You know there is nothing in this environment that you are not in movement with.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.620
From your perception, it's a lot of separate things.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.620
In reality, it is movement.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:17.620
And so, again, sir, to you I would say that the environment that you are in presents this jeopardy

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.620
because they are confined into one limited area.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.620
This makes the power of it stronger and there is less likelihood of it opening up.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.620
Now, the one fortunate thing is where it is placed.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.620
I see it on a vast mesa.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.620
Open, pretty open area, is that true?

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.620
Absolutely.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:45.620
And this is very helpful because you see there is a movement, a harmony of land and sky and cloud,

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:51.620
wind moves through there and that does help to dissipate a lot of that.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.620
And it is a fortunate choice to place these institutions out in such areas

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:04.620
and not, say, in the heart of the city, where there would be even more impact with a difficult mindset.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.620
Because the land itself vibrates to help them, you see.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:14.620
There's a movement within the land because there is no separation between the sand and the sky and the sea

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.620
and the building and the beams, you see.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.620
There's this movement, this constant exchange.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.620
Have I made this clear to you?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:34.620
This matter you said that talked about success in lives, like two lives and two lifetimes,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.620
how does that relate to us?

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:49.620
Well, there is always, there is always a focal point in a sense that we would call in this case, Louisa Aiken.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:58.620
Alright, now, Louisa Aiken perceives herself as the same person with various changes moving through one lifetime.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:10.320
Now in reality, if she could see herself, she would realize that she is now a tremendous composite of a great many other people's images, movements, thought forms, and so forth.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.620
But there still is a centered core around which some of these adhere.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:25.920
Now the most important particles, the most important movements, coalesce into the strongest particles.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.920
Now I'm not speaking necessarily of the most positive or the most negative.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.920
I'm just saying the strongest...

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.920
It's as if there's a magnet named Louisa.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.920
And certain forces are drawn to her,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.920
and some pass right through her,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.920
because there is no responding magnetism of any kind.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.920
And they just become unimportant.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.920
They do not affect the core of the person.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.920
But on the other hand, certain other things move through her

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.920
that have a tremendous correlation, that have what you would call a hook-up.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:07.920
It's almost a molecular, it is a light hook-up within her, of correspondence, of vibration.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.920
And they stay with her.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.920
And so it is this essence that we speak of as Louisa.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.920
Now, to go, to say two lifetimes ago, is very helpful for her at this moment

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.920
in understanding her situation with this woman.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:27.360
Now if I were to speak from another perception, I would say there is a residue within this

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.960
woman, within Louisa, that needs to be dissipated.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:39.040
It will be dissipated through the giving of light to this manifestation outside herself

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.560
that she sees as this other woman.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:48.600
In this giving to her, the thing will be, the molecular tension will be broken and this

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.600
will drift away from her and no longer be a part of her.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600
Do you understand me?

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600
I think so.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.600
Would you like a clarification?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.600
Well, I was seeing, I think it was the same thing,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.600
different people that we meet that come through our lives,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.600
and I have noticed this in myself,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.600
that some of them, you just automatically feel a great closeness and a love

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.600
and of enjoyment of being close to them and being with them.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.600
There are other people, very nice people, very good people,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.600
that you don't feel that same attraction for.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.600
And I have wondered about that. Is that what you're saying?

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.600
That they're on a different vibration?

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.600
That's true. They're not important for what you are a composite of at that moment.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.600
For example, someone who in your terminology is not very spiritually evolved,

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.600
evolved, is the term that you use. What you really are saying is that the vibrational

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:55.600
impact of that person is pulling toward it like impact, and it is on the same frequency

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.600
level. Now, as that person allows themselves, and this usually often has to happen in times

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:08.600
of crises, in times of crises we act in different ways. We have the power at certain junctures

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:16.520
life. When a call is made, this is why crises are so important, the crises come into the life of say this so-called lower

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:32.600
evolved person. The crises breaks them into, jolts them into an asking. Now, they ask. This is our chance, you see. Because prior to that we cannot

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.600
We cannot just keep hounding that person and hounding that person.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.600
Their free will is what motivates what will happen to them.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.600
The crisis comes, the crack in the armor, they call out in whatever way,

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.600
"Oh my God, help me. If you will help me, I give you promises to do this, this, this," and so forth.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.600
Many times we see this happen. Many times they relive on them in later times.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.600
All these promises are just forgotten. That is not the point.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.600
I pointed that at that moment there is a crack.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.600
The vibrational entity has said, "Help!"

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.600
The minute this cry comes, we then begin our movement.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.600
And we move with them as long as they ask.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.600
And we would move with that entity until the day the entity chose to move to the light.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.600
If they would hold that, you see, if they would hold that call, but they don't.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:37.600
The crisis is resolved, they go back to their normal way of existence, they're very grateful that they're still, you know, alright and whatever, or if their son has been saved.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:46.600
You know, many times we see this kind of thing. The promises are forgotten, or if they're done, they're done as just a debt to be paid.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.600
But, but, with that call, something has happened, you see.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:38:02.600
Now, with that little wedge, they are then able to have another light harmony move for them, you see.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:09.600
It's as if there's a crack in the sphere, and the light rushes into that sphere, and it remains there.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.600
And it draws to it, its own likeness now, which is life, you see.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.400
And eventually, as the years go on, as lives go on, more crises happen, as is the designated plan.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.600
One of the main reasons for crises is to continually crack this sphere open more and more and more and more

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.600
until it is nothing but a ball of gold and white.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.600
That is what we're really aiming for.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:43.600
As each one of these crises enters in, it cracks it open more and more, and each time, you see, more rushes in.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.400
you see, and that gives them a greater chance the next time to call it like form

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.800
because like calls like, you see, and much of the sphere may still have

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:59.400
pressing on it the negative similarities, but then we mustn't forget that that is also here, this light

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:05.400
and what happens so often, you see a young child with a great many problems

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:11.000
and you think poor thing, poor thing, from our perception this is not true, you see

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
It is often the opposite. Some of the strongest entities in the life cycle are those whose childhoods were extremely difficult.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Because it's at these junctures that they intuitively call out and bring into them, through their call, more of the light.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Do you see what I mean? The child that has a perfect upbringing and has a lot of joy and a lot of love,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
often times we'll find in the 20s, 30s, 40s and so forth, then they begin to have the cracks

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
in the sphere. Now this is something that's set up ahead of time and doesn't need to concern

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.000
us. It's set up in certain ways because of certain desires. Some of the hardest incarnations

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:01.000
are taken on because of the anesthesia's deep desire to get on with it, to just drop much

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
of this in one lifetime.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And although things on the outside look tremendously difficult,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
actually they've been wise in many ways.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
But I still sense your question.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
There was no Louisa Aitken two lifetimes ago.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
There wasn't even someone who we now call Louisa Aitken.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I mean, the changes that she has gone through,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
not only as an incarnate being,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
but in the freedom of the other planes in between her incarnations,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
there is no likeness at all.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
There is residue.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
And this is what we speak to in this particular point.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
There is a residue.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
[inaudible]

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yes, yes.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
[inaudible]

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Yes, that is the kind of meaning that I'm seeking to convey.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[inaudible]

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Right, now, had this woman...

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
It didn't have to be this particular woman from two lifetimes ago.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Had you been aware earlier in this lifetime, there were other instances,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
other connections with other people that could have removed this from you.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But the fact was that you, at those particular junctures of your life, you were working on other things.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
You see, there's only so many things that you can deal with at once.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And so we're always learning.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
And we move from one awareness to another, you see.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
And now, here is this one, coming at a very right time.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Right for you and right for her.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
The circumstances are set.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
You have the time.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
You're not working on anything else at the moment.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
This gives you the breathing space to work with it and deal with it and remove it from your life.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Do you see it?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Did I answer your question?

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
What's your question?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
What's your...

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Do I understand that you have been my teacher or do I have been your teacher?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
direct contact with the human as a matter of fact,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
is better than using a cell phone to make...

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I think we should de-postpone that.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.000
The type of connection that we seek to make,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
and we can make that,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
is best done in the hours of the night,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
when the world,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
The place in the world where you exist is in a quieter state.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
It will be easier on the woman at that time.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
The channels would be much easier for her in the evening.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
She has a certain intuitive movement with her child.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And in the evening when the child is in bed and taken care of

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.680
and she can remove this situation from her mind,

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.840
she is much freer to do this.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.320
And we have to be careful of her too,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.320
because she's a part of this whole process,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.440
and we are trying to be as understanding

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.480
about her needs as possible.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.840
But by all means, and please ask it again

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.560
in an evening situation, and I feel quite sure at this time

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.760
that something of that nature can continue.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:57.760
[inaudible]

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.760
None of this that I say now should be repeated,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.760
because he would not be able to hear it.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:12.760
But the image of this gentleman

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:19.760
is one of many, many layers

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.760
of desires.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.760
It's almost as if there is

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:34.760
layers and layers of serpents of desires winding around his, the pole of his center being.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.760
Is the image clear to you?

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.760
And there are many, many of them around his center core.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:45:02.760
and he is drawn to the quest because of his decor of the being, which is of course the same core as the rest of mankind.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:09.760
But in this particular case, he would do much better to spend his time forgetting, almost

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:19.760
putting aside the question of the spiritual quest, and concentrating on the human quest.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:26.760
He is not even a successful person in a functioning sense in the human material world.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:36.760
and there is no grounding, he is not grounded in the sense that he is always in a state of flux

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:43.760
I see this, the image is given of movement, constant movement, not movement upward or movement downward

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.760
but just kind of a dissipated movement in all directions

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.760
which is interpreted to mean that his energy is simply going off in all directions

00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:01.760
There is no... a person who is that dissipated in the sense of energy and in the sense of desires,

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.760
he has many desires that he dissipates at will.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:16.760
There is no steady, compact, concentrated impulse.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.760
It is all dissipated.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760
But what we will say to him is this.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:27.760
Are you going to play tape for me?

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:38.760
I think it might be better if you simply give him a quote and then just tell him that the tape is with a woman or whatever.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.760
Because I do not feel that he needs to be chastised.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.760
The problem is similar to many people.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:47:00.760
He's drawn to the spiritual world because he seeks to avoid responsibility.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.760
And he feels that if you are a spiritual seeker,

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:11.760
then you can overlook many of the mundane responsibilities

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.760
that the human body is expected to perform.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:28.760
My advice to him is to spend a considerable amount of time looking within and finding

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:35.760
the thing that at the moment it seems to him he most wants to do, whatever it may be.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:41.760
On the physical plane now I'm speaking, I'm speaking in terms of work, in terms of job,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:51.760
and whatever he decides to make a vow in himself that for five years he will remain with it.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.760
Five years.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.760
And stay with it.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:03.760
And in that time, to not indulge in mind fantasies of what he would like to be doing,

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.760
but to keep the power, you see what we're aiming at,

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.360
that if he can keep himself in a compact situation,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.260
if he has promised that he, from himself,

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:19.560
if he has promised himself that he will remain in a certain place for five years,

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:25.760
he will draw to him the concentrated, compact consciousness

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.360
that is the primary prerequisite before you can even begin

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.860
the most elementary stages of a spiritual quest.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.860
And you see, this gentleman doesn't have it.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:43.860
And one of the reasons he doesn't have it is his continual moving from place to place and thing to thing and person to person

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.860
and thought to thought and fantasy to fantasy.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.860
He needs to become compact.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.860
So, five years, one job.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.860
That's it.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.860
And no fantasies.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.860
Please make this very clear to him.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:02.860
It will not do him any good to stay in one thing for five years,

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:09.860
gritting his teeth with the determination of "I hate this, I don't want to be here, I wish I were doing A, B and C."

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:15.860
The idea is to get his mind so concentrated on what he is doing

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:25.860
that he would be able to perceive the joy that is inherent in any occupation.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:30.860
In any occupation. There is inherent in it a spontaneous joy.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:40.860
a spontaneous enjoyment, participation, all things are possible in any position you take.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:50.860
So this would be our advice to him. A five-year commitment, and see if he can work on it.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.860
Now make no other statements around it, for example.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:50:00.860
Please don't say, "Five years commitment to one woman," for example.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.860
That would be extremely unwise.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.860
And do not in any way please stress discipline.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.860
Like, whatever he chooses to do on that periphery is really not important.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.860
It will be sufficient until the day he will be able to do this one thing,

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:25.860
think of finding the spontaneous joy and creative response in one job for five years?

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.860
I don't want to have that kind of thing.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:34.860
I want to know how the person will overcome their over-tempted reaction,

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.860
or negativity, to the act of the person.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:43.860
Well, that's a good question, because it's plagued for many years.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.860
Basically, she needs to understand one thing.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:57.860
The negativity that comes from others to her is essentially not terribly important.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.860
She tends to feel that things are more important than they really are.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:10.860
She, uh, someone will say something to her, the person who says it to her is perhaps being very, very casual about it,

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.860
and doesn't even think about it in the next five minutes.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:20.860
but she herself is taking it in and grooves on it and worries on it and so forth, you see.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:27.860
Now, this is an old habit and can easily be broken and it must be broken and it's in the process of being broken

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:33.860
and the step that she has to take is the minute that she feels, for example, someone says something to her

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:40.860
that hurts, that makes her feel unworthy or depressed or inferior or there are many things

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:47.860
that one could feel. And by the way this applies to many people and not just to the woman herself.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.860
The first thing, the first thing that should cross her conscious mind is I choose not to

00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:01.860
dwell on this. And that's the first thing that I would do. I would say, "I'm not going to

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:08.860
And then, if she still feels the pull of that kind of, because all it is is an indulgence

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:15.860
in a negative kind of a thought situation, then all she has to do is to say, "I choose

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:21.860
to dwell in," and then pick something else, "whatever is most joyful for her."

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:29.860
In her case, most definitely just to choose to dwell in the presence of God, which is

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.860
which is very much what she does most of the time,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:38.860
is try to feel, even to the physical feeling of the God presence around her,

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.860
she's moving into that kind of an awareness,

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:47.860
and is able often to feel the pulsations of the higher forces directly around her.

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.860
And if she would just make a conscious choice of saying,

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.860
"I don't choose that," you see,

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.860
and then not to continue to think on this thing,

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.860
to drop it and to select, to choose this other,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.460
and to move into those feelings.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.460
I think she will find in, I would predict, in weeks,

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.260
not months, in weeks, excuse me,

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.460
that she would be able to drop out.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.860
And I would suggest to other people who might have access to this data,

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.260
the same process.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.660
Each time something comes into your consciousness, you have a choice.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.660
You can take it in and become obsessed with it,

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.860
and deal with it and worry about it,

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.260
or you can say, "I choose something else,"

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.760
and select whatever it is that brings light to your mind rather than darkness.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.260
It's simply a choice.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:37.260
If a symbol of the void is beautiful, that should be dwelt on.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.760
If the light or the cross or the Christ or the whatever,

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.760
those symbols should be... that is what they're for.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.760
The symbols of the world are there for you to use,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.760
and that's the kind of time that we ask you to use them.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:58.760
She also likes to sing along to the Christian music, which is all around her.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.760
Yeah, well, I think it's a wonderful thing.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.760
And I highly encourage her in all aspects of it.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:12.760
Now, it is not for everyone, and she must be aware that there will be much criticism,

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.760
and in ensuing years there will be controversy over this course,

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.760
because it professes, as you know, to come from Christ himself,

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.760
and there will be a great deal of controversy.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.760
Now, she has thought about this herself,

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:37.760
And the answer for her is, I believe you're all aware of the fact that the Course says that it is Jesus who saw him with his feet.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:47.760
And in a sense this is absolutely true. There is nothing in that Course that does not come from the highest source of the Christ vibration.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:57.760
Now, it is really not important to say, "Does it come from the persona that we consider to be Jesus?"

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:04.760
There is nothing that is in that course that does not reflect the highest,

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:12.760
the highest that the Christ, as personified by Jesus, has to offer.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.760
and she can go into it without any trepidation whatsoever.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.760
Many people will not understand it. I do not encourage her to talk about it.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.760
I think that she should, especially around very orthodox Christians,

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.760
should make absolutely no mention of it.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.760
They will do what they can to underline it.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.760
And she should let them go on their way, because everybody needs what they need.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:47.760
And this is a very definite response to her soul call for guidance.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.760
And I use it often to connect with her, because she believes in it.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.760
You see, she responded immediately to the deep truths that lie there.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.760
And she is able to throw out the extraneous and dwell on the essence of it.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.760
And this is why for her it's so very vital that she continue with it,

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:14.760
because she is able, out of all the pages and pages, to pick those kernels that are the highest

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:25.760
and to begin to believe what it is that she needs to believe, that she is, you see, a part of this whole drama of God.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.760
So yes, by all means.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.260
You mentioned the persona of Jesus.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.760
I guess what you said about the person,

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.760
that he was in the concentration camp,

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.760
the persona of Jesus,

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.760
and a lot of the verses in the Bible,

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760
you mentioned.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.760
The persona of Jesus is, in a sense,

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.760
so much more powerful,

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.260
so much more radiant,

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.260
so much more awe-inspiring

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.760
than it was 2,000 years ago,

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.260
that were we to meet him

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.760
on the earth plane today,

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.760
as they did then,

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.760
then it is doubtful that any physical vehicle could encompass.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.760
I mean, he too has moved to realms, you see.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.760
There is no end.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:14.760
It is hard to explain, but there is no end to the capacity to expand into the total Godness.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.760
Did you understand?

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.260
There is no end to the infinite.

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:29.260
And the persona of Jesus in the two thousand years since he left the earth plane

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:35.760
has continued to radiate and to grow in life and wisdom

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:43.260
that those who tune into him now are given so much more than they were two thousand years ago.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.260
You see? Because he himself has moved to...

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:54.260
He is so much closer to the totality of things than he was then,

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:58.260
that his gift throughout the century increases.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:02.260
You see, it's so funny, the world says 2000 years ago,

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.260
and puts him as an old archaic form.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:11.260
In truth, he is so much more now than he ever was,

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:16.860
that he is an even greater gift to mankind now than he was then, you see.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.860
And it is so opposite.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:23.660
He is the source that I draw to.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.860
He is the source that I look to for my wisdom.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.060
And in my state of exaltation,

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:39.260
I do my very best to reach the heights that he was a two thousand years ago, you see.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:52.260
And he has so far transcended that now, that someone like myself could walk the plane, the earth plane now, and be considered on that vibrational level.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:05.260
But not him. If he came back, in the form that he was, I mean that he is now, we won't even speculate about that.

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.260
But, are there any questions in the room?

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:19.260
[unclear]

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:27.260
Well, again, there's been an awful lot of disinformation filtered through various people on this subject.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:33.260
And it is true that he will come again, and bless this world with his soul.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:40.260
Now, when we say "He will come again," it is so hard to put into words, but as I try

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:47.260
to explain, the physical vehicle that walked the earth in 2008, the physical vehicle that

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:52.260
walked the earth in 2008, the physical vehicle that walked the earth in 2008, the physical
