00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000
[inaudible]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But I don't hope you understand it because I don't.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Anyway, the only expertise I have is in my own experience.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And nobody can match me in that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And my real life's purpose has been to know a little bit about a great many things.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In contrast to that, I know a lot about many things, but I don't know very much about any of them.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But that's been my thing. My thing is medicine and general practice.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I know a little bit about a lot of ailments, but I've never become a specialist.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In the sports field, I've studied the teachings of all the great religions.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I know a little bit about many of them, but I'm not an expert in any of those fields.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But that has been my thing. My way of having fun.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we've done lots of fulfilling on the inner drive, but nobody knows your blueprint except

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And don't put this shit on anybody else, and don't let anybody else write his shit on you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Don't let Basalamu put his shit on you, if it doesn't feel like it's what you want.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And so, back about 20 years ago, I took a couple seminars in technology.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I got interested in science, and actually used the books of Christopher Black Murphy and Roy Burnett, some of the guys.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So I played with technology and made the versions with a few people, plenty of machines, and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a lot of bright and hard-to-read type of things.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I've used it a few times in my practice, and it's been a good portion of my life,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I say it again for our friends and family.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
My wife gave me that prescription for her nephritis.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Most of them without telling me what it was.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Because in our country, the future, many people are frightened by the worst.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
They've heard the strange things about us and people get so over it and they seem to say hypnosis,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which is rather repugnant of many people, to say we're in that stuff that's progressive.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
And so she didn't call him, no, she said, "I'm going to teach you how to relax."

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.000
And so she got along very well with Old D.Pace.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Then, Mary Margaret, as I said, was a nomad in Barbican.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
About 1963, I think, was the first semester.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'd gone to Los Angeles and advised a group at a psychologist's office

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
who has been to many more talks,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as well as Stanford's research,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is essentially my transfer to the experiments,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and so on and so forth.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And he's done a really fine research program,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and very well done.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
My margaret has been to so many,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
a number of other people,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and so they were meeting every week at the psychologist office,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.920
material. So I was invited to go and talk to them because we had explored that with

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.560
President of the University of Houston, Carolene Maxwell. And as a child, we're curious to understand

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.480
it. And so if I invite you to come and talk to them, that's where I first met Mary Marty,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.320
when I was in sixth grade. And we've known her over the years. She's been our friend,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360
She was a very kind lady.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.360
She had a lot of different homes where she lived in California,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.360
up in British Columbia,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.360
Calif., Santa Clara, and so forth.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360
So,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.360
so, one time she was at a place called "Place H"

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.360
where she lived, and she went back to her last town of Kennedy in Palestine.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.360
And there she was born a protestant prophet,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360
sort of, saying "Hello" to the Japanese.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360
So,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.360
then a few months later,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360
a few dozen months later,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.360
She was having some personal problems and came down from Santa Fe talking about events.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.360
She says that maybe if we use hypnosis, we can go back to something that could cause a problem.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.360
And then, man, man, man, man,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.360
uh, he came down on that, uh, early December 19th,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.360
so, seven, five years ago,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.360
he came down.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.360
And the main reason, no, was to find out what's on him.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.360
So I said, "Okay,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
the induction technique works quite well."

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.360
So then I said, "Would you go to some of that in this lifetime or some other,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360
that will help us to understand

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360
He said, "About 60."

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
He said, "About 70."

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.360
He said, "About 80."

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360
He said, "About 70."

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360
He said, "About 80."

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.360
He said, "About 70."

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360
He said, "About 80."

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360
He said, "About 70."

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360
He said, "About 80."

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360
He said, "About 70."

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.360
And I said, "Anybody else there?"

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.360
"Yes, there's five young monks working on it."

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
I said, "How old are you?"

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360
"I'm about 60."

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
I said, "Have you always been a monk?"

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
"I've been a monk for a while."

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.360
"No, but you've seen me."

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360
"No, I've had a wife and children."

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.360
"No, but the Turks killed them all many years ago."

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.360
"And I came out here to this monastery to be praying to the gods."

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.360
So this is situation.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.360
And at this point there is an interruption.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.360
There is something obvious, a different ending, a different personality, a different feeling.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:31.360
But we have been working for this moment for a long time.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.360
And we are glad to have this opportunity to speak to you more directly for you.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.360
you will present a problem to the three powers also.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.360
Well, what a good, but that's kind of a pity.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.360
Now, if I'm interested in Mr. Moore's performance,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360
what Mr. Moore would have to say to me,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.360
I have to take some of the blame,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.360
but Mr. Moore would have to be very kind and tell,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.360
and just go over there and say,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.360
To yourself, not to him, but to yourself. Remember why we changed it.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360
Remember why we changed it.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.360
So, she started telling him.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.360
The same began to change.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.360
Probably, I suppose, because he was changed.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.360
He was not responding.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.360
He was not responding with anger.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360
That was probably what he said.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.360
But, sure enough, he said, "There will be a substantive communication if you will do this.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.360
I said, "We'll make changes in him too."

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.360
Later on, well she was, after my mother came back from Norman County,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360
and I told her about what happened, she was

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.360
"No, Mr. Curry,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.360
you mean I'm going to be a psychic?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.360
I don't want to be a part of that."

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.360
And I said, "Well, this could be different."

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.360
I've had a lot of experience with psychic in my 25 or 30 years,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.360
I had to find out whether the death of the body was a random one.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.360
I found out.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360
But I had experience with many sizes.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.360
I was born with many communications like this.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.360
And to me, this felt...

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.360
It was something authentic to me.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.360
It spoke as the book says, as what would happen in Florida.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.360
So, I tried to be assured of it.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.360
But I felt that something was wrong with me.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.360
So, um, she didn't want anybody to find out about it.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.360
She didn't tell Justin about it.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360
Because, well, naturally I did.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.360
But, uh, about, uh, I think it was March of '78,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.360
Justin, who was a counselor at the State Penitentiary,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.360
near Santa Fe,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.360
Mary Margaret was just staying at St. John's College in Santa Fe.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360
It was in the summertime.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:09:04.360
And uh, Justin was attending a big conference, a conference of great scholars, which was part of a Canada town like so, forgotten which one.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.360
And about 45 people got sick after that.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.360
And the icing was black, which was very serious, often serious, and there were at least some two-points.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.360
There were two or three of them died I think.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.360
And we'd have a session with our talk and we'd have a session with our talk and we'd have

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.360
a session with our talk and we'd have a session with our talk and we'd have a session with

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.360
our talk and we'd have a session with our talk and we'd have a session with our talk and we'd

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.360
have a session with our talk and we'd have a session with our talk and we'd have a session

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.360
And we'd have a session with Bartholomew.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360
We had the bypass session.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.360
So finally she told him about Bartholomew.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:01.360
And he came, well he was recovering from his baptism.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.360
He and Martin came to our place and spent a few days with us.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.360
And he had his first conversation with Bartholomew.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.360
And uh, Mary Magdalene was pretty tense about it because, well I believe they let go of

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360
her when Gwentolyn became a girl with Jocelyn.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.360
It wasn't a big deal for her.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:32.360
But today, Gwentolyn said to Jocelyn, she said, "Mr. Moore, you made a commitment before you

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360
came into this life to go to the top seriously.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.360
You have been failing in your commitment and so has the woman.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.360
Baham, you always talk about the woman.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.360
And so has the woman.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.360
There is important work for you to do in this life.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.360
Now I think it's about time that you got to say goodbye.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.360
If you're hearing, Baham, you're supposed to say goodbye now.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.360
If you are, I think it's important that you get to show on both.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.360
Just, yes master, yes master, yes master.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360
And he did that.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.360
And the opinion on that was remarkable.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.360
So things began to be different with him.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.360
And that Marty said, he didn't believe that at the same time as he was before.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.360
And Justin said, "You know, when I started seeing the top of my tongue, I had a lot of questions I wanted to ask."

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.360
And he said, "You asked it all before I ever asked any of it."

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:38.360
They were told that if your past internment has been very nerve-wracking, one last time

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.360
you will be very serious about it.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.360
They said that one last time is a very important thing.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.360
They said that another last time could be very sensitive.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.360
They said this time you are bound to go for the top, seriously.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.360
They said that you haven't been doing it.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.360
So then, then, things began to be difficult for him.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.360
Then, and then, when Bartholomew, well, when this entity interrupted,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.360
this past life of my father, that is to say, my nephew, had given the name of Bartholomew,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
I said, "What is your name?" He said, "Bartholomew."

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360
He was his nephew's name.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.360
And so a couple of sessions later, I said to this entity,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.360
It's really not that I was wrong, it was a past life that I had.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.360
You should know that I was close enough to that one at that time that the vibrations and such I could commit.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.360
And so I used that as an opportunity to begin this work.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.360
So then, well I said, "Can I have a name?"

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.360
He said, "There's a name to call it by." And I said, "Well, name's not important."

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.360
He said if I wouldn't do this to him, unfortunately, he would always be much excited by me.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.360
He said the skeptics would be even more turned off if I said I was Jesus.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.360
And he said some psychics that I've controlled, I've heard, whether he's Jesus or not,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.360
they think, "Oh, I was here. You know, this is how my community thinks."

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.360
And I don't get turned off.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.360
And if a person I knew, he said, "Call me the dog. It doesn't matter.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.860
Call me Joe if you want to. Names don't matter.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.860
Look what I say to his students, he's gonna do something.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.860
But his names don't matter.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860
So we called him Bertone.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.360
He never tried that life that he had his first lifetime.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.860
There was a case that I don't know if you folks have heard about Bertone's past life.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.360
You heard that very impressive thing.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.860
And at that time he said there's tons of other nice things.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.260
But if I told you about them, I was kind of arrogant.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.560
Yeah.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.860
And so, since that time, I suspected that I know who they were.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.060
Yeah.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.860
Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't tell you.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.660
I don't know. But I think one of them was Saint Francis of Tisza.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.860
Because a lot of people know all the details of Saint Francis' life.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.560
And the other was Ramona, who's picture I passed around about me.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.760
because 5 different people in Socorro, who had come to our meetings in Socorro,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.760
I saw them communicate with each other,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.760
had told me, each one in the penitentiary,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.760
"You know, I saw one of the world's teachers on their day."

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.760
One of them said, "I saw a bearded man similar to Martin Luther King."

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.760
So I got that picture and I passed it on.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.760
And I said, "Does it look like this?"

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.760
He said, "Yes, that's exactly what it looks like."

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.760
So I was telling this to a group in Detroit,

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.760
there's a people learning machine that was on in Detroit last spring, I was at work.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.760
And, uh, finally the group said, "Well, maybe it's fixed."

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.760
Because there was one of my groups saw that same thing

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.760
when we were up here giving a workshop in Detroit.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.760
So, I asked what they were on about.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.760
"How about this, what's it on this thing?"

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.760
He said, "Well, let us just say that Bartholomew has never been absent from any of our sessions."

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.760
He means Romano.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.760
"Well, Romano has never been absent."

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.760
Romano does some strange things.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.760
"Romano has never been absent from any of our sessions."

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.760
And I myself have been working with Romano for years.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.760
I found his teacher 20 years ago.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:44.760
The teachings are identical to those of Barsalami, except Barsalami puts it in the current idiomatic language with a little more sense of humor than Vermont Head for Naps, I don't know.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.760
But I think there was something, some relationship there when Barsalami first came up with my map.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:58.760
Somebody I'd known for a long time. And somebody knew how everybody was taught.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:05.760
And so at that first session, after he told me what to tell me about it, he said, "Tell

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.760
the woman to do this about her problems."

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.760
And then he said, "You need to give me a question."

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760
I said, "Sure.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760
First question, can I get my paper to her?"

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760
He said, "Okay, get your paper to her."

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760
So I went back and came back, and he was waiting patiently.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760
So I've been taking everything.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760
Unfortunately, I did not know that that first question was going to be a question.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760
I didn't know that it was going to be a question.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760
I didn't know that it was going to be a question.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760
I didn't know that it was going to be a question.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760
I didn't know that it was going to be a question.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760
I didn't know that it was going to be a question.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.760
that I've been taking ever since.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760
Unfortunately,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.760
I did not learn it that first time,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.760
which is a lot.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.760
You don't learn first

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.760
things, but I think you learn

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
a lot of things.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760
But,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.760
it's been a frightening

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.760
experience for me to be on the whole thing.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.760
I was struggled there for about

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.760
25 or 30 years

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.760
I was finding some of the greatest teachers in the ancient religions

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.760
and Ramana is my favorite.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.760
Then, when I found him about 20 years ago,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.760
Ramana said, "For me, this doesn't mean you all should have it."

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.760
And I said, "Ramana has been around saying the same thing,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.760
but with more emphasis on the past," he said, "something like that."

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.760
I thought, "Well, that's how many centuries, that's how long ago."

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:25.760
So I said to Barbara, "You know, I don't come back because I want to hear what you say, I come back because I love you."

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.760
So, she said, "It's my love."

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
And he said, "Yeah."

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.760
So I made sure we went back to another side, because I made a lot of mistakes.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.760
But it's a good thing that I'm still here.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760
I'm still here.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760
I'm still here.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.760
I'm still here.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760
I'm still here.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:54.760
I don't know if I'm saying this right, but to me, if someone who speaks for the project,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.760
who knows what he's talking about, and his best work is that with individuals,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.760
we asked him about that one time, and he said, "Well, I'm speaking with one person,

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:12.760
a binary group, member with their energy, but I don't see you as project, I see you as vibrating energy,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.520
energy and more and so my energy is maybe what you're in it because so there's real community

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.760
so you can really

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:28.520
really go into your situation but you don't need to be nervous i don't i don't

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.040
i don't look into things you don't want to know

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.080
they get in a group the energy is more diluted

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.480
And so the group tapes I think are excellent for many purposes.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.280
It's not the best word, kind of, for this work.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.680
And some of the recent readings by me and my expert on social media,

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.280
some of the readings by men on the internet,

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.680
the handwritten learning with a book called Justice,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.880
the pen with a question in a weekly outline,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.480
some of my writing pages about the problem,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480
And they did it!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:15.480
And uh, Mary Margaret said not long ago she said that she was first sighted, first mailed it, that she was pretty tense about it.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.480
And she didn't even know about those people.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.480
And then she got scared off the track.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:30.480
And a few weeks ago she got a letter from someone with an English name and, and by then we started talking, getting to reading for this person about her Jewish background.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.480
Now you might think that this must be wrong, this must be wrong, because in the end, they

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.480
talked about a Jewish background, because she didn't have a Jewish background.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.480
And she didn't have the problem of the pathology of that kind.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.480
So maybe it's beginning to be like, he kept the fact that this character mostly talks about.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.480
It's interesting, it happened about two years ago, when we were talking about pathology,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.480
I told her to run, my wife's a loser and all that.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:09.480
And Johnson, he said, he was a long time before she ever was willing to talk to a group of

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480
people.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:17.480
One time, at the end of the day, I asked her, I said, well, if you couldn't talk to a group

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.480
of people, could you make a case for it?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480
Oh, yes, I could.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480
So you better stay.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.480
But my mother said, "Don't let that hate get out to anybody else. If it wants to make money, you'll have to know about it."

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.480
So I kept it very quiet.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.480
Then, sometimes, six months later, I told him, "I think maybe she's over the top."

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.480
And he's been very careful not to switch her if you don't know about this.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480
Of course, he's been very temperate with him.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.480
He'll ask her questions.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.480
She said I have access to a vast area of information.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.480
So I asked her to text me, but she only sent me a few.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.480
She said she didn't want to see me.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.480
Then she said she didn't want to talk to me.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.480
And I said I think she really wants to talk to me.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.480
Then she said she didn't want to go to the dental clinic.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.480
And after a while she said she wanted to.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.480
So I said I'll be good on her part.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.480
I said maybe she'll watch me.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.480
She would be helpful in the form.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.480
You may model something while it's on there.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.480
You may model something while it's on there.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.480
In the beginning, she said it was like a dream.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.480
If you had any strength in your thoughts, it's real.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.480
If the hypnotist says you will remember it's here, it's off the ground.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.480
If the hypnotist says you may forget this, which some of them do,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.480
my system works so that you may remember that you have a dream that you want to.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.480
And so, in the beginning, she remembered the experience.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480
Well, it's like a dream.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.480
Some of it came into the important point, too, of the numbers.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.480
But then she gradually came to that suicide that was not a dream, though.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.480
And then she just had to learn to do it after a while.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.480
So, it kind of made her a patient in Santa Fe, and that's how she got to Cornell, and that's still there, and that's a good thing, though.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.480
And then I said, "This is John Togliatti, I'm going to come in now."

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.480
And then almost all of us would say, "Good morning!" or "Good evening."

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480
And come and help us.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.480
And that was his very first experience.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.480
Her experience was just about equivalent to anybody else in the room.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.480
They came in just like the rest of us are.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.480
She heard the questions from the audience.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.480
The world is all in her hands, she's the one with what it's going to say.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.480
And yet her mechanism is unique and unadvanced.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.480
So it's hard to explain, it's true.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.480
But yes, in years of now, this has been her presentation.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.480
But she has a slight insight into what life's going to have before her.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.480
Did you ever hear of any of what was really on the list?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480
Just the...

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480
What was by far the most?

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.480
Well, I'd say it's not as bad as it's making me think.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:11.480
I'm not going to forget that. I can't go back to 50 years and fix that.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.480
I don't know. I didn't find out.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.480
My wife didn't find out.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
Her wife dead, I don't know.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.480
Somebody took her by the arm.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.480
If you're having some, that's good though.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480
It's general.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.480
It's good time for you to tell your wife.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480
Well I don't know.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480
But then, then!

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480
But you have characterized yourself as wearing a John MacDonald suit.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480
You have characterized yourself as John MacDonald, you know, the one you wear in the vehicle

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.480
from the movie, right?

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480
Yeah, yeah, I found out about that.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480
Yeah, I was a board member for Paula Jury, my best group for him.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480
Now I'm John MacDonald for the Don.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.480
So here's the band over here.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.680
I don't think we're wrong, sorry.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.380
We don't know what it looks like to hear.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.580
Yeah, my guess is that it's a reference to a problem.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.380
Yeah.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.080
Makes reference to a narrative problem in the middle.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.380
To a theme.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.280
For example.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.580
But makes reference to my own idea more as the example.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.980
As the example?

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.480
Yeah.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:46.980
No.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.880
Because we're wrong.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.680
No, I don't think it might be an example, I would think.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.980
You know how somebody could live?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.980
Remember all this?

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.980
All my mistakes.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.980
All my mistakes. I don't remember who's mistakes I made.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.980
But he would make mistakes like this.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.980
His mom used to be a counselor.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.980
She taught him about the four of keys.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.980
I don't know if you hear that.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.980
That guy's ringing the bells with me and I don't know.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.980
But he was never sitting there up in the bathroom.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.980
So I don't know what that is.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.980
I'll explain that later.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.980
I'll see if I can find any information on the world.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.980
If there's any questions, anything, I'll try to find out.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:41.980
If you see a person with a normal life, they're going to choose that person.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.980
More than probably yes.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.980
Not as much as they could probably.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.980
Even though they're going to go right to the hospital.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.980
And good kind can take pretty things to the past, just like the rest of us.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.980
No, she has to not be a true witch-hawk by any means.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.980
And she goes out of her way to convince him with not anything to look up to.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.980
She said she gave a workshop at the San Diego, and they wanted to put her up on a pedestal.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.980
So I made a point of saying bullshit a few times.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.980
So the dream rider was just a high-end deal in his face.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.980
No, she doesn't want to put on a face.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:27.980
I would normally tell her, if your ego ever gets involved with her, this, this, can't stop.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:33.980
But I've never seen it in the case where it has been, having to involve her.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.980
She's very, very humble person, but not too much selfish.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.980
She doesn't want to think what man is responsible, she also thinks,

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:48.980
I'm not going to say anything about Romana.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:27:03.980
I found Romana about 20 years ago when I was getting some books from a bookstore in Indiana

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:10.980
And when he sent me this book, he said, "This book might be a little too old."

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.980
He said, "If it's not, send it back tomorrow."

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.980
And when I saw that book, I thought, "This is it."

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.980
And it has been, ever since.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.980
He was the man who was born in 1975.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.980
And he was 10, 10 years old.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.980
He got to that age.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.980
And he was a young man.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.980
And he was getting 10 years old, he got what he said was some spiritual understanding.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.980
And one day, he said, "Well, if this body dies, then what am I?"

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.980
So he laid down on the floor, made himself rigid, and had all the feelings of being dead.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.980
And then he said, "Well, the body's dead, but I'm not dead. So the body is not on it."

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.980
And he achieved that realization at that moment, which he never lost.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.980
For the next 60 years or so.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.980
60, 70 years.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.980
There was a young man, 17 then, who dropped out of high school.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.980
And went off to an ashram in South India.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.980
In a little town called Dhirigadamilai.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.980
There's a mountain there that's the state of Sureshiva.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:25.980
He sat down in that temple, in the temple courtyard, and just sat there for a year or two.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:35.980
And the other people around there found it surreal, given it happened in this country, they were flossing up, getting intoxicated or something.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:41.980
But there they understood. So they took care of him, turned the bullseye and walked some more, I guess.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:48.980
The answer to the way where we got on the ground on the surface or the thing is up to him, I would say.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.980
But he was completely unconscious of it. He was living a world of bliss.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:59.980
And they forced him to leave the house, or somewhere else, he didn't care what they thought.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.980
And finally, the guy, he responded to it out of guilt.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:11.980
And so he stayed there at that place and never left it for the rest of his life.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.980
So people came from all over the world to see him.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.980
One time, towards the end of his life, they held a party called Darshan, where if you

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.980
left on a holo-band, you gained some bad karma, some incase understanding.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.980
This time it was some kind of a ritual, and he was in the middle of it.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:36.980
This time it was some kind of a celebration or a holiday.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.980
There were thirty thousand people outside just to look at him.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.980
He had his back up.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:50.980
So he's not well known worldwide, but he is known worldwide in small groups.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.980
Alan Watts, for instance, used to have one of his paintings on his wall in California.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.980
I've seen this picture in many places around here.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.980
In Vermont.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.980
He never took anybody from anybody.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.980
He never made himself out to be better than anybody else.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.980
Somebody asked him one time, "Would you be like this?"

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.980
He said, "Yes, but you'll be running."

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.980
He said, "I'll be running."

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:44.980
I'm not saying that you should be a good person, but you should be a good person.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:51.980
But this reminds us, as I said, it doesn't speak to everybody.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.980
It reminds whole people to find out who you are.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.980
Come on out and I'll admit it. Please.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.980
I was at work tonight, you know.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.980
See what we can do there. And you never can find out.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.980
Not this way.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:34.960
[ Silence ]

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960
Yes, yes, yes.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.960
That's part of the Lamarckian mindset.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.960
Lamarckians are always thinking, "Oh, I'm compassionate.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.960
Lamarckians are always thinking, "Oh, I'm compassionate. Lamarckians are always thinking, "Oh, I'm not wasting."

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.960
They've heard of Lamarckians.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.960
Mahārūṣa. You've heard of Mahārūṣa in my own travels.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.960
Mahārūṣa. Mahārūṣa means great in Sanskrit or Hindi, whatever the language is.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.960
Like Mahatma Gandhi. Mahārūṣa means great. Ātman means soul, too.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.960
So Mahātmā means a great soul, Gandhi.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.960
Mahārūṣa. Rīṣa is a word that means great people.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.960
So Mahārūṣa is a very great people.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.960
Because Shri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, Bhagavan is the Lord.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:41.960
So the Hindus are very slumbering on their religious ideals.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.960
So they make a big to-do.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.960
The Jain people are very austere.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:52.960
So the Hindus are very slumbering on their path, I would say.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:00.960
So, in Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, the great, honoured Lord Ramana, the great teacher.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.960
So, when you say Ramana, I don't know any other teacher who uses that particular concept.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.960
The Maharishi, yes. But Maharishi.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.960
So, usually when I talk about this, I just say Ramana, because when I say Maharishi,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.960
Let me think of that other case, which has no relationship to this man.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:33.960
And so, the past, perhaps in past lives, I have some connection with that same antithesis between Ramana, Vatsalva and Surya.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:39.960
And that Ramana entity was the same as the Bhajan entity, if there's any such thing as an entity.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.960
I'm not sure if that's the right way to say it.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.960
But we have to talk about it because we don't want anyone to understand it.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.960
So if that is so, then at least the flag has that kind of value.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.960
And it became an and began to take shape.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.960
Which we now call the song.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.960
So, I have a question.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:06.960
The difference between the two states is not the relationship of the two states.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.960
The difference between the two states is the relationship of the two states.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.960
That's up to your listening, I presume.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.460
You see, there is nothing separate.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.960
No one are not separate.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.460
The mind tells us, yes, we have separate bodies.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.460
This is the ego game. The ego game is the game of separation.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.460
And so we take all these bodies and play this game of separation.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:40.460
And sexual separation is another exaggeration of our feeling separation.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.740
Now, if you are deeply in love with someone,

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.300
then you feel separate from that person.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.320
No.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.460
There's something.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.420
There's something in here that says we are one.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.540
And when you begin to feel that one,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.700
not only for a special person,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.540
but for everyone.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.780
The Buddha said,

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.700
"You should love everyone as a mother loves her own child."

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220
That's the most efferent way.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.220
The head creates efferent.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.220
The ego plays the game of efferent.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.220
We are in competition.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.220
Because if you get that goody, then I can't have it.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:29.220
So I fight to retain my possession.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.220
So now I beat everybody. The ego fights everybody.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.220
But the self, it can't get away.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.220
It's one with everybody.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:43.220
Instead, the thing that goes wrong is the mind has been trying to get us to realize

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.220
that there is no one here in us, but we are as love.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:56.220
God is love and we are created in his likeness, and that is why we are.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.220
God doesn't have a body like this, except he does, he has yours.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.220
My dad dresses up like everybody.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.220
Put on a mask.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:13.220
Here is Paul, here is Michael, here is, you know, all of them.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.220
This is God's expression.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.220
No words on the ocean of penance.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.220
Each word is meant to separate.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.220
But there's no difference in those words.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.020
Can't a raindropper turn into an ocean?

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.020
It is the ocean.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.020
It doesn't really get lost. It is the ocean.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.020
And so the moment I find out who you are, that's who you are.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.020
No separate ones.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.020
But the hell doesn't bother me.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.020
And many people are not interested in playing that game.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.020
They want to play an evil game.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.020
They come here for that perfect, evil thing.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:03.020
And so, if somebody's not interested in spiritual things, that's one.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:13.020
Probably the best analogy of what life is all about is Jesus' little story of the cargo ship.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.020
He left home to go out to explore the far country, having self-attached.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.020
When things got rough, then he said, "We can't remember."

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.020
Then he remembered his father's name.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:33.020
And then he said, "Maybe it would be better if I go home. I no longer deserve to be my father's son because I've just taken one month off my inheritance."

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.020
And that was the last of it.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:45.020
"But maybe if I can get a job on the farm. Maybe a farm has a good enough job. And that would be better than this situation."

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:50.020
So he took off for home.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.020
"No one has left our father's house,"

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.020
Clark called it the Great Separation.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.020
Back before time was, before this universe was,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.020
there was a time and a source of human race

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.020
who only contained a handful

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.020
separated just from the source

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.020
to go out and play these games.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.020
Young men and young women who left home,

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.020
left their father's house,

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.020
to go out to play these games.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.020
Now if someone had simply left one man,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.020
Why are you still making fun of me? Come on.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.020
Come on.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.020
Hey bud, you don't belong.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.020
You know, you really shouldn't be out here.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.020
Really, don't bother me.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.020
Don't bother me.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.020
So this is what most people say.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.020
They say, you know, you should get all those kids that could

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.020
really find out who you are.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.020
Don't bother me.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.020
It's not kind to bother anybody.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.020
But, if someone is

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.020
in the situation of that young man

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.020
He said, "I think maybe I should go home."

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.020
Something in him said, "My name is Colin. I want to go home."

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.020
Now, when he gets home, what happens?

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.020
Does his father follow the Christian tradition?

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:06.020
He says, "No, you can't take anyone to have someone home until they're dead."

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.020
He must go through a ritual to sit down on their knees and apologize.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.020
He must be paid that amount.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.020
Is that what the father did?

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020
Yes.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.020
Welcome.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.020
My son has been dead, now he's a lawmaker.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.020
We must have a party for him, let's have a celebration.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.020
Yes.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.020
B'tzalma says, "God does not judge or condemn, God only loves."

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.020
I think in that little story, it makes that point.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:43.020
And so if you are ready to find your way home, fine, then B'tzalma is for you.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.020
I don't think we'll find a better seat.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.020
I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean you're no better.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:55.020
You're not ready to talk to Wendell.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.020
No. Don't bother with it.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.020
It's a lot of nonsense.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.020
But to me, that little bit of a societal shock tells the whole story.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.020
Of why we're here, what it's all about.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.020
That's what it's all about.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.020
Yeah, but the people have to come first, right?

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.020
Yeah, well...

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:26.020
First I want to make a speech of, um...

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:32.020
Now being a good time to go home,

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.020
Today is a good day, is it not? Yeah.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.020
Today is always the best time to go home.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.020
So we're going to need to not only resolve it now,

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.380
So now, Jesus said, not only for the time of the struggle,

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.860
today is the day we will hear His voice.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.180
Because there is no other time.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.820
You can't find God next week, next month,

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.860
on some other planet. No, right now.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.500
God is always present, every day.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.740
God is just as much within you as He was in the Christ,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.260
or is in the Christ.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.860
Just as much.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.300
God is manifested more than before.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:14.940
But there's no more of the divine within that abjigi or the mangottama or the Buddha.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.740
If you manifest that, that's it.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.540
And that's what you should expect.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.540
And you have to get...

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:27.180
You have to be still in order to do that.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.380
You have to get this mental clarity to work out.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.340
You have to begin to focus and find out where you live, if you live here.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.340
How long we've lived up here in the hill?

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.340
And the hill is up there.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.340
The hill can be a good hill of itself, yeah.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.340
But that hill has become a monster.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.340
In that sense.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.340
We've had a way out of it.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.340
It's been about,

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.340
Bob told me, four years ago, he said,

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.340
"We need to get more out of your hill, to move on."

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:01.340
We've got to stay low. Stay low, and think that.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.340
Not that we should leave anything,

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.140
I don't think you can leave any of them out now.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.140
You can leave the two members of the team.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.140
Just the two of them.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.140
The four members.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.140
The original masters.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.140
The one top team.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.140
I don't think you can leave that to me.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.140
You can leave...

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.140
You can leave them out to vote here.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.140
You have to keep buying.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.140
On my part, on the pilot's part.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.140
With the other people's part.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.140
But yes, very natural fuel.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:41.140
But that line makes him to make it look like it's something that's totally turned off.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.140
It never gets turned off.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.140
Wastes a lot of energy.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.140
That power saw is very useful too if it happens. He wants to saw bore holes.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.640
Or if he wants to drive a tornado, does he keep the saw racing?

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.640
No, but that's what he does.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.640
He said, "Think and find."

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.840
So all day and night he was thinking, "What a big rest he's got on.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.640
What a bunch of assholes. I wonder what's gonna happen tomorrow."

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.440
So he locked up this right here.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.440
So he finds himself there.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.740
And because he's thinking about something else,

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.840
the way he's got to be caring about his girlfriend,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.340
the way he's got to be

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.340
Well, hey there.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.340
You didn't make trouble?

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.340
[Laughter]

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.340
I like the sound of that.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.340
Yeah, it's a real good glimpse into the future.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:35.340
But I think the basic of it is saying that's what future seems.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.340
Here I am.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.340
Because this is the time. This is it.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:45.340
If you were simply knowing that money could prepare us,

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.340
it doesn't just end well.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.340
Our imagination creates the future.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:57.340
I think I've been very fortunate, I've had a very interesting life.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.340
I've done a lot of things, seen a lot of things.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:09.340
But this was one of the things for me to be the reason for all the rest of it.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.340
I've seen a lot of things.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:17.340
But this performance seems to me to be the reason for all the rest of it.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:24.340
It's my job to try to find people who can make for English again, this sort of thing.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.340
And to make it available to them.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.340
I don't think I've ever gotten to more important than that.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.340
Although, who knows what's important.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340
I don't.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:44.340
I asked my father, and he said, "No, you were not with him when he was called Romano.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:51.340
You were with that family, there were several past and present, when he was in the Buddhist

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.340
tradition.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.340
Both of the householdmen were associated with him at that time.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:01.340
I asked my Romano, "Why is it that the Han are Buddhist Christians?

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.340
I asked Bartholomew, "Why is it that the Hannah Buddhist teachings are so appealing to me?"

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:14.340
He said, "Well, it's all about the formless and also the teachings of the Ramana, who was born in Hindu today."

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.340
"But the Ramana teachings are not merely so much Hindu as they are Buddhist."

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:26.340
So, as Bartholomew said, "The cause to know yesterday Buddha at that time, when he was on the planet."

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:33.340
I don't know, but it's like a form of human gesture.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.340
I don't know.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.340
It doesn't matter.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:42.340
But the mind gets to worry about things like this, you know.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.340
You say, "Oh, that's right.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.340
She's putting on the American show.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.340
She's a nun."

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.340
I'm not.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.340
You're ugly, too.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.340
So, you're not going to be able to do that.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.340
I remember that message, you know what my story is?

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.340
Yes it is, but I don't want to tell you my story about his past life, this could be a long story.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.340
No, that's a sad story.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.340
I know, I know, but that could be a long story too.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.340
Yes.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.340
I was born in 1902 on a farm,

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.340
no, in February of '63.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.340
Grew up on a farm, 10 miles out.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.340
Went to Penn State to study agriculture

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.340
and ended up in the military.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.340
I was a soldier.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.340
I was a soldier.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.340
I was a soldier.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.340
I was a soldier.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.340
I went to the States to study agriculture and ended up in liberal arts.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.340
Went to provide a seminar in Chicago for a year.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.340
I was a Presbyterian Pastor.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.340
I wasn't ordained.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.340
I was in a little church in Iowa for a year.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.340
After I taught high school there, preached the show.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.340
And then I decided that the

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.340
Pastor who would lead the class was not my thing.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.340
So I got out of it.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.340
I became an atheist for about 10 years.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.340
That's all it was.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.340
and went back to the farm

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.340
and I started to fast

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.340
I got a job teaching children

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.340
I think I was in high school in Pennsylvania

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.340
so that's in Pennsylvania

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.340
a little town called Prospect, North Africa

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.340
for a few years

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.340
and that's where I got involved

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.340
and my wife and I were still children

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.340
took off for Penn

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.340
to see the world before we got too old

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.340
we thought that might come pretty soon I guess

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.840
I worked there, then as a patient I got a job at the College Park and Railroad Express office.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:28.840
Then my mother left a couple thousand dollars and in 1933 we took off for four years in medical school, both of us.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:36.340
And children were three, five and six at that time, so I said, "I can't do it with the children."

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.340
I said, "We'll make it somehow." So we worked together and we both managed to get through.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:47.740
We practiced medicine in Missouri for 10 years, general practice in a small town.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:53.740
Our boss died of a heart attack when he was probably better, he was about 42 years old.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:05.740
My mother moved to New Mexico in 1948 and started the general practice there.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:20.740
And in 1951, our youngest son, he was 22 years old, was in the Navy during the Korean, yes, the Korean Unplugged, right?

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:27.740
And he was a radar operator on a plane, orbiting at night training.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:34.740
Delivered mail to a base in New Jersey, but they're actually picking up reports and files on it, they're uncertain.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:40.240
This came back in, I'm sorry, March 1951.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.740
We never heard, never saw him again. We heard from him later.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:48.240
Then in 1953 I cracked up my airplane.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.240
The other tenants, they all managed to get out alive. I was the only one hurt, fortunately.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.740
At that time, they'd taken him on Japanese people.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.740
I was probably officer with the police in practice.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.740
And uh, I said I don't know why I'm bringing these books here.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.740
Because I don't like them myself.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.740
If one was filming, I'd hate life after death.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.740
Might not believe that kind of stuff.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.740
I had heard so much less of it when I was in college, 10th grade.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.740
And uh, figured, well he was pretty sharp.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:23.740
If he believed this stuff about scientific and spiritual communication,

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.740
I don't think I've ever much thought about that book, but...

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.740
And it's...

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.740
This, yet again, is this other book, from my mom.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.740
So this is a question.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.740
That, in fact...

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.740
Well...

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.740
It's for a lot of reasons.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.740
I mean, I don't know.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.740
I don't know.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.740
I don't know.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.740
I don't know.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.740
I don't know.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.740
I don't know.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.740
I've been to a lot of sites.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.740
I think Ford came.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.740
He spent four days with us.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.740
Arthur was with us.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.740
I think he's dead now.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.740
He came to our place.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.740
I've been running stuff in a little place like this.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.740
I've never done anything like this before.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.740
You know, we've been to world capitals.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.740
We've been to a teenage infirmary and stuff like this.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.740
We've come to this little town.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.740
I don't know why.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.740
But when the people's lives are taken,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:24.740
But when the people's lives were taken, and so it was, so this gave us an insight into

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.740
the psychic thing.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.740
Where in 1957, the older characters at that time of tradition, also psychic people, were

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.740
described as it.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.740
They got on a sailboat trip, once again, later to Lucerne in 1957, with two other guys.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.740
Eighteen foot sailboat, a strong cast iron for both, they rode the bottom of the boat

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740
all night, got the mast, blew the horn, and then they got on the boat again.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.740
And they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat,

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.740
and they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat,

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.740
and they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat, and they were all in the boat,

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:39.740
He was out on a sailboat trip once again, Lake of Canoesia in the 1960s.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:40.740
He was two other guys.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.740
18-foot sailboat, a strong cast iron for both.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.740
They rode the bottom of the boat all night.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.740
Got the mast loose somewhere on that side and got the boat turned over.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:57.740
But, um, the other guy, his don, or son, John, I think that's his name,

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.040
Well, he picked up two of those letters, so we did find out from that.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.540
Still in my very conscious.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:07.540
So let's put the pressure on us to find out what life's all about.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.540
I've been kind of tried to go to an A-game, you know, and uh...

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.540
We did go to a basketball tournament in Texas, Missouri, because, kiddies...

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.540
I got to ride my little T-shirt, kid.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:24.040
My dad thought we ought to go first, you know, so we said, "Well, let's do that, let's go."

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:30.540
So I would have been carried twice, I was sprinkled with a type of clay and dumped without a care in the world.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:36.540
So you guys, you know, really, not many of you have ever thought of this, of this growing plant.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:43.540
So, when I was 59, when I first started, and just opening up a hole,

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:48.540
I was understanding it, but I'd never run across it before.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.540
You know, you know, do whatever society.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:59.540
And he had all this stuff going. I was amazed at the amount of research that he had done by qualified men, scientists, and engineers in the field.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.540
Because really, there is life after death. Really, there is death is nothing then.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.540
And then, that was the lesson I took.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:12.540
Well, death is to survive, but death is to die. That's actually my question.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.540
What's it all about?

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.540
What's the whole picture?

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.540
Why are we here? Where do we come from? Where are we going?

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.540
So I began asking those questions.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.540
Then I began to ask questions and began to get answers.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.540
And then the books of the mystics began to come up.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.540
One way or another.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:37.540
Then, Reverend Andrew Hill, St. Theresa, St. John of Bronx, all the Christian mystics,

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.540
and everybody in the Hindu tradition, the Buddhists, the Zen,

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:48.540
And he began to provide answers to those questions, and finally he was here, and he was like, "What's it all about?"

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:54.540
And the time he comes along, he confirms all the things that John had said before.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:59.540
That's a long story, but maybe that's as brief as it gets.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.540
So, how fun.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:11.540
I'm not going to say it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.540
It took me a little bit away from that.

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.540
Did the communion take place at all?

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.540
Did the communion take place at all?

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.540
Yes.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.540
No question in my mind.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.540
Because what we did.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.540
Yes.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.540
I asked a couple of other psychics.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.540
We found a number of cycles, some of them were very poor.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:39.540
Communication, it's a little bit like the radio, which is what it meant.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.540
So, there's that a way.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.540
Well, I built a little one-tube set when I was teaching at the institution.

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.540
No, yes, in Iowa.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:57.540
Back in 1924, we were teaching live.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.540
And I'd never moved one page fast.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.540
With headphones.

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.540
And one night on that set that I had built up my own little thing,

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.540
I heard a voice say, "This is Kent, this is Radio KMS Los Angeles."

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:15.540
"Oh my goodness, Kent, you're not doing that much. It was wonderful!"

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:19.540
I know all the statics, as you may remember, was all regular.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.540
A lot of statics and nothing much else.

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.540
But I know I'd heard Los Angeles.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:29.540
Well, sometimes it's not my place, there's a lot of status.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.540
In some sites you get more clear stuff coming through.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.540
Like RG40, it was a really good one.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.540
RG40 was just 80% of what came through, it was probably true.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.540
With Bethany, I'd say 95% of these.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:48.540
But I still don't accept that it worked on me, because I don't make it my census.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:58.540
A voice and a joy on a spiritual life gives it to us one to one day.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.540
And this grace I would have. I think to me it's a great opportunity.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:10.540
And when I talk about one to one, you see the feeling that is, the great insight that is,

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:17.540
I never really knew what love was until I felt what all of us love, everybody who has come

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.540
before.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:27.540
I can never see anybody who has been tough about the way I live today, but I'm turning

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.540
into this guy and feel his love for me.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.540
It's been a tremendous experience for me.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:50.540
And so, I think we should, we should be like some of the fundamentalist brethren are in the Christian tradition.

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:54.540
They think that every word of the 6th is literally, verbally true.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:56:01.540
You know. I don't believe that. I never did. But they relatively do.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.540
And I don't think we should make that mistake with the Psalms.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:08.540
That is a great communicator who is doing a tremendous job.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:13.540
But look at what he does, if it makes sense to you, then do something with it.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:16.540
As much as don't just listen to yourself.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:20.540
If it doesn't make sense within your life, then waste any time applying.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.540
And so this has been his attitude.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.540
And if it sounds too good, then use it.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:33.540
But if my approach doesn't appeal to you, find someone else who does, and then go work on yourself.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:40.540
And I'm not going to be able to do that.

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:49.540
I'm not going to be able to do that.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.540
I'm just glad we're doing this again.

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:23.540
Because I found you in that comment specifically on the source, on the course in those.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:36.540
That's interesting, I heard that quote in relation to that certain deal.

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:43.540
That means, in that blog, that's what's all over the, I guess, the median time, too.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.740
Well, did anybody ever be in town with anybody else?

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.840
No sir, but I was in town with a person reporting in.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.840
I don't, I didn't say that.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.640
I said he recognized the person.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.640
No, I didn't say that 100% no.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.840
Finally, you asked me a question about, uh,

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:09.040
his stuff materials. I read some of the material and found it horrendous, but nothing, you know, nothing to impress me for.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:14.940
But, finally he said that one of the disciples had to come back because he had made some minor mistake.

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.740
He had to come back and go through more life times of pain.

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:21.340
I don't remember. I never read it myself.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:26.740
But finally he asked Fox his question. Fox said, "I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that discussion."

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.140
The words said I was right.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:34.940
So this would be very unjust to hit somebody to a pain by someone like that for some minor mistake.

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.340
I do remember saying this about the test here.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:44.340
But don't take anything to be totally 100% true.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:54.340
Before you start it, the better thing, um, don't believe everything that's written in your script.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:58.340
Don't believe anything that's all the right that I've said.

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.340
Don't believe what's been taught in our tradition.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.340
Don't believe what I say.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.340
Unless you check it out for yourself and it makes sense to you.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:22.340
I think I'm just wondering if I've got an idea about health and what it's like for you.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.340
I don't know the answer to this.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:31.340
I'm so sorry that in many money-bending cases,

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.340
in many money-bending cases,

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.340
there's only a potential murder coming to town.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.340
Now, this question has gone up a little bit ago.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:45.340
At one time, they gave the bars the money,

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.340
like this was done in the late 80s, so I've forgotten why.

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.340
And the bankers wouldn't lend me any money.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:58.340
And they finally commented one time, he said, "I thought any bank would be willing to lend money for a purpose like this."

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.340
He said, "I'm learning many things in my time last year."

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.340
So I thought, "Damn, I'm smart now."

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:07.340
In 2012, she became the partner of my bargain company, Satchel.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:13.340
When it comes to past years for two, I was 100% on what bargains is.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.340
If it's time.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:23.340
Now, we had one case where a Bartholomew master, a Bartholomew teacher from Ohio, New Mexico,

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.340
came through.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.340
Very impressive, very impressive.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340
I was sorry we didn't back off a bit there.

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340
But he said one time, he said, "Remember, this woman makes mistakes.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340
There are mistakes in communicating.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340
My brother Bartholomew makes mistakes.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340
There are mistakes on all levels.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340
You all make mistakes."

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
And so, I said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a story."

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
And he said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a story."

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340
And I said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a story."

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.340
And he said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a story."

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340
And I said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a story."

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.340
I'm not going to make a mistake in communicating. My brother, Bartholomew, makes mistakes.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.340
There are mistakes on all levels. You all make mistakes.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.340
And so, I kept this in mind.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:53.340
This is what the photo says. Check it out. This is what I have reported. Check out what I have done to students.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.340
To school teachers.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.340
They've been hearing what you've come to say.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.340
It's amazing.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.340
Some of the things I don't accept what some of the people...

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.340
Maybe it's because I don't know enough.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.340
Maybe someday I'll understand, I'll say "Oh yes, I see what you mean."

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.340
But we don't have to accept it just on faith.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:18.340
Boy, you find faith sometimes, but even with the knowing, it's still...

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:27.340
[laughter]

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:34.340
Now, even since Austin, I now know what I'm going to believe when someone else is worried.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:44.340
That's not the most important part of the Bible because I know who my health is, which is kind of, and I'm prepared that he is able to teach that which I have committed to him as I have taught the other.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:49.340
Yes, but hold on a second, there's more than one experience I know.

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.340
I used to disbelieve it because somebody said it to me.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.340
This is my thing, this is my answer.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.340
If I ask you an experience, I'm an expert at that, yes.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:05.340
Okay, so I'm going to ask you to tell me when you started doing yoga.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.340
Tell me after you started. How long ago did you start doing yoga?

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.340
25 or so?

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340
Yeah.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.340
Okay.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.340
What got you to doing it? What set you doing it?

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.340
Obviously, as you did it, you understood the value of your training.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.340
Just as you had enough breath for it to be able to train for it.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:35.340
But what's going to be the goal from once they've communicated, once they have that communication?

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.840
