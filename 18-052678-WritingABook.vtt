WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
He could not walk the earth plane. I mean he literally could not walk upon the earth plane

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.460
This is a very complicated

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.180
We certainly won't go into that because it has a lot to do with energy force fields and so forth

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.360
but in response to your question

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.800
out of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.120
The the being that we now would call

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.080
Jesus

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.580
that has moved in two thousand years time to what he is now.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.080
A part of his polarity, a part of his being will choose

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.080
and has chosen to manifest on the earth plane

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.080
and bring with it the wisdom that is needed for this coming age.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.080
There has been a lot of talk that there will be three of them,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.380
seven of them, I believe this is part of what they are saying?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.180
Yes.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.080
Um...

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.180
This is again a misinformation. It is true,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.480
it is true that incarnating now and in the ensuing years

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.680
will be people

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
who will be able to understand and respond to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.980
this highest vibration.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.280
So in a sense, you see, this is what they're saying, that these

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.880
specially gifted spiritual leaders will be on the earth plane, and that is true,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.720
but it is also not true to say that,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380
and I must argue with this one,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.220
in one of the books it is written that I believe it is Paul,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.080
Peter, I can't remember, it was one of the disciples that supposedly is to come back

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.580
to the earth plane because of an incompleted work with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.260
with at the time of Jesus of Nazareth.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Yes, that's stated in one of the text books.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.360
Well, with all due respect to all of that,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.760
two thousand years of anyone having to wait that long

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.260
in order to overcome the minor difficulty that he experienced

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.460
is very unfair and totally unlike the God-like love and wisdom.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.500
That is not a true statement. Do you understand me?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.400
I understand.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.940
There is no reason that God or anyone would ask that a man, an entity,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.180
wait two thousand years to redo something that was so minor as to not...

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.620
I mean, if those laws were in existence, we would all be in great jeopardy.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.420
So, yes, he will come again,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.680
in the sense that a concentrated power-packed form of spiritual energy is going to come to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.860
the earth plane in order to try to get the balance going in a more positive direction.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.320
There is great need in this world and there is a lot of great chaos in the world and even

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.680
Even in the so-called enlightened countries, a term that we find very funny, you see, there

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.320
is tremendous darkness and chaos.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.520
And I will say that there is no guarantee that even the coming of this beautiful being

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.520
will be able to tip the scales.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.920
It depends on the hearts of men.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.820
Always has, always will.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.560
You still remain free to choose.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.720
This does not mean that God's plan will not fail.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.720
It does not mean that God's plan will fail, it means that all men are destined to come to God.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.720
When they do it is up to them.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.720
It may be this time, there is always an opportunity because God is ever loving, ever present, and ever caring.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.720
And he will not abandon his children, but they are the ones that must choose him.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720
Is this clear to you?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720
Yes, may I ask one more thing?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.720
Yes, I do.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720
Sure.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:21.720
If the spiritual tone that is struck through the second time, however it manifests,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.720
is insufficient to take the still, then what can we expect to follow?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:39.720
[Sigh]

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.720
Well, you see, what happens is,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.720
when the spiritual world tries over and over and over again

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.720
again to impress itself on the hearts and minds of men. And this is another exalted opportunity.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:10.800
But if the minds of men turn, then what you can expect is what has happened in the past,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.000
which is a period of greater darkness. Because one of the sad things, and one of the gambles,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:28.060
so to speak, about such a coming, is that the darkness becomes strong too. You see, it's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.060
hard to explain, but when a tremendous force moves into the world, it activates what is

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.660
there. You see? It doesn't just activate what it is, it activates, it is the power that activates

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.380
all, all powers that are now existing on the Earth's surface. Do you all understand me?

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.140
It does not say, "I am a good light and I will only activate good people."

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.580
It says, "I am power.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580
I am power."

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.300
This is very clear in the story of Jesus of Nazareth.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:06.140
The reason that the Pharisees were so opposed to him was because he was so powerful and

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.820
it brought out power in them, do you see?

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.460
But the problem was that their power was for destruction, was for isolation, was for separation,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.860
and so they chose to destroy him.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.580
his very power activated their power. It goes back to our first question, which is, we are

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.740
not separate. This being will come into the world and the people around him will have

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.100
an opportunity. They will either respond and open and crack their shells and call out and

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.300
become lighter, or they will use the force of his power and become more of what they

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:49.420
already are. So if the experiment fails, then we are left with a great deal of power of

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:57.660
what you would call the darkness. And this is foretold in various parts of the Bible.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:07.820
And so all we say is, "This is why last night your master spoke to you and why I speak to

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.380
your wife and I say please if you cannot do these things for yourselves then will you

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.380
please do it for the world?

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:26.860
I know one more question and then I'll finish.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860
Have I answered you?

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.860
You certainly have.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860
Should the woman use the I Ching?

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.860
Should the woman use the I Ching?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:46.860
Tell her only when she's feeling chicken and she'll understand me.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.860
Should she use the I Ching?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.860
You see, in a sense the I Ching is counterproductive for her.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:04.180
What I'm working for and what she is really working for herself also is a really, thank

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:12.860
you, this is fine, is a direct contact with wisdom that is spontaneous and ever present

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.860
and she for the most part tries to work with this but then something extremely difficult

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:25.700
will come up and she has then fall, a tendency to fall back into her old habit pattern which

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.360
is I don't know anything and when she says I don't know anything then she goes to the

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.900
I Ching and throws the I Ching and uses her own wisdom to interpret what's in the book.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.700
It is a device, it's a gimmick, it's a trick and it has worked for her very well and she

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.940
she does it very well. She's extremely good at it. And I do not mean in the slightest

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:55.540
to condemn the I Ching. It is one of the great books of the world and has helped more people

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:03.940
than most books. However, in her case, tell her what I said. Use it only when she's chicken.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:10.260
It would be much better for her to be able to take that same time span that she spends

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:16.980
with the I Ching to put herself in a closeted situation and get within and reach for an

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.980
answer within herself and then be courageous and try it. But it doesn't hurt her, you understand,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.200
it doesn't hurt her. And if she's in such a state of confusion, if the question is so

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.700
personal that she's not able to become quiet and clarified on it, then by all means, yes,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:52.700
is

00:09:52.700 --> 00:10:02.060
evening. Now we will suggest that the vehicle relax, go further, and experience a sense of

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:10.860
lightness, wellness, happiness, serenity. We will count from five back to one,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500
Returning to normal consciousness.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:21.500
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:34.500
This is a session with Bartholomew in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the 26th of May 1978.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:45.220
And now you will relax, breathe deeply and slowly, feeling yourself going deeply into

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:55.580
a state of relaxation, of inner peace, quiet, calmness, stillness, preparing your physical

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:03.420
vehicle to be used as a channel for higher intelligences.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:12.420
And when I count from one to five, you will be very, very deeply relaxed.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.800
And when conditions are appropriate after that time, we will ask that Prathalamu come to

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.500
visit with us.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.420
One, two, three, four, five.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.420
Good evening.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.420
Good evening.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.420
Good evening, Bartholomew.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.420
Are there questions?

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:46.020
Yes, Bartholomew, I have a question I'd like to start things off with.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:54.820
With regard to a reference that you had made about a book, we were wondering, Mary Margaret

00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:03.860
and I, whether this, perhaps what you meant by this, would be that we should work, we

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.380
should be working on a book.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.380
Is this true?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:14.260
Do you mean each of you separately should be working on a book?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:20.220
Is this the thrust of your question or if you should jointly be working on a book?

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.380
we should be working together on the book.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:43.380
I would say that the question, as I seem to understand it, is should this book have anything

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.140
to do with the work that the woman is doing?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.940
Is this the meaning of your question?

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.300
That is correct.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:13:04.940
The question then remains, who would be the one to work with her directly as this gentleman

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.940
does?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:12.420
Well, perhaps I could serve in that capacity.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:19.420
I think that it would be worth an experiment to see if it would work.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:30.780
The reason I have to be so vague here is that it very much would depend on the relationship

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:38.180
that the two of you have, you see, because this is a total matter of trust.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:45.280
And if things are going well with the two of you, then I would think that it would be workable.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.380
If they are not, then I'm afraid that there might be some, shall we say, static in the

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.380
line.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:14:03.580
So I think that since these two live such a distance as to really make it difficult for

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:10.580
any kind of sustained, say, weekly organization along these lines, that it would be worth

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.660
a try. And I will answer your question now directly, which is, was my statement about

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.460
a book in relationship to the work that she's doing with me? And the answer is yes, that

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.460
is what we meant. But we could no more have told her that at that time than, well, it

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:34.180
would have been totally impossible because if these other two will remember at that time

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:42.920
in this procedure she was extremely reluctant about the whole thing and we had to in a way

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.720
appease her in many ways and one of the ways we chose to do it was by saying that this was

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:57.440
a very limited ability that it would be terminated in a shorter distance of time and so forth.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.940
One of the reasons we did that was that it wasn't at all sure at that time that it would continue because of her reluctance.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.940
You see, she has a great inner reluctance to believe in this.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:18.940
And I repeat again, I would like all of you on her behalf not to be critical of this faculty and her.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:29.940
Actually, she was chosen precisely because she has this constant drive to verify the data,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:38.940
to make sure that this is a clear line, to prove the things as predicted, do they become truth or not.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.940
And this is the highest kind of integrity in this kind of work.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.940
and it is rare for us to find a channel who has this integrity who doesn't.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:54.940
Our usual experience is that they are so excited about it that they jump totally,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.940
immerse themselves in it, and it becomes the entire focus of their life.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:07.940
And when this kind of situation exists, it is very, very unhelpful,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.940
you know, both in terms of what people are given and what happens to the vehicle itself,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.940
because then it becomes a tremendous ego satisfaction.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940
Do you understand?

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.940
Oh yes.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.940
So please encourage her.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:28.940
For example, she will in the next few months more and more try to test out the truth of what is being said,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.940
and please be absolutely honest with her in your responses.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.940
She needs to get this so-called, in your terminology,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.940
feedback from all of you to understand.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.940
She is really in a vulnerable position in a sense

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.940
that she has to depend on others who she loves and trusts.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.940
And the three of you in this room, she loves most in the world, except for her offspring.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:59.940
So we would ask you please to understand that,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:06.060
that, to be tolerant of that in her and to help her in any way that you can.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:11.860
So I say, sir, that try it.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:20.300
And please, if you do decide to do it, if it does become a vehicle, please be extremely

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.900
meditative on the type of questioning that you would reproduce.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.580
By that I mean make sure that the quality of the question is worthy of the time spent with

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.580
it.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.580
All right?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.180
Yes, now I gather from that remark that you will not be dictating the content of the book

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.340
to us.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:48.060
If you and the woman decide to do a book, most of the profits of the book will be for your

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.020
own development and your own awareness.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.660
a by-product of it will be that it will also be extremely helpful for others.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:03.500
But the main focus, you see, we would never work in a way with each of you to do something

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.700
of such a scope that wouldn't be of absolute benefit to you also.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:15.300
I mean, this would be a pointless way to spend your life Earth, I mean, your lifetimes, your

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.420
Earth times.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:26.860
So what my meaning here is simply that you will meditate upon, please, the questions.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.380
You will agree jointly on the procedure, how it will be done, what questions will be asked.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.620
This in itself will be a learning experience for the two of you.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.740
You see, you don't have very good communication, the two of you, and this will be a way to

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.780
open up those lines of communication on the deep level.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:54.420
Having to decide jointly on a list of, say, chapters and the content that will go in will

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.600
be an interesting experience for both of you in learning how to work together.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:06.520
So I say that deeply meditate before asking, jointly communicate together.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.180
She is not to be used, please, just as a vehicle in this case.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:19.680
should be directly consulted on what will be asked. And she will be, it will be

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.720
important for her to be constantly aware of the of the material. You see, if it

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.320
comes in one day then she should hear it that day because she she has tremendous

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:37.840
doubts and it needs, and these really need to to be set aside. So pick a time in

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.680
in the not too distant future when things are going very well in both of your life, both

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.400
individually and mutually, and attempt it.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.160
And it would be helpful if you would get some data from this gentleman as to how to begin

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.320
the sessions.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.200
And you will know as you go along whether they are successful or not, and she will certainly

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.360
be able to tell whether she is in a state of receptivity or not.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:14.080
Have I answered your questions? Yes, I just have one other on this topic and that is

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:22.760
should there be any static or if for some reason it doesn't work with my serving

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:31.280
in Dr. Aikens' capacity, then does that preclude our going through the project

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.760
or could we work with the Aikens on it? Admittedly it will take longer because

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.760
because we'll have to plan certain chapters, we'll have to drive to Socorro to do it, but

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.000
I mean, if it doesn't work out in a more convenient fashion, is that an indication to forget the

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
whole thing, or can we go to a second plan with the Aikens?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.600
Well, that would depend on the Aikens.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.720
It depends on their desire to help in this kind of enterprise.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.240
I would say that this would be an appropriate time to ask them if they would acquiesce to

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:12.320
such a plan or not? I would consider it an honor. Then I think that your answer lies

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.880
there and I think the beginning chapters might be best done with all four of you

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:26.840
together. With the gentleman in all of you together at the beginning and him

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:34.200
showing the procedure and giving you any any type of information necessary. So if

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:42.560
If you, if I, you see we do realize the inconvenience of this, you see, to do the driving and so

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:50.840
forth, but truly I think the end product will be worthy of your time.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:58.960
The next few years are very good years for the woman in the deep sense that she is in

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.520
in a state of receptivity that she hasn't been in for years and is dropping much of the residue

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.520
of lifetimes and lifetimes of karmic buildup, if I may use a misunderstood phrase there.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:20.760
But it is time for her to get into the deeper senses of herself. She deeply wants to do

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:26.840
this on one level because she really would like to serve, you see, and she feels that

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.840
her whole life she's been very selfish, she feels.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.840
Now this is not our perception of her, but this is her perception.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:41.840
So if you could, in the first beginning stages of it, travel the distance to Socorro, if you would.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.840
Oh, it would be no problem.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:53.840
And then, if it, then in the presence of the four of you, if it happens then that the contact can be made with you as the guide,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.040
then things can splinter off from there.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.080
And you will all know the movement, the correct movement as it proceeds.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.600
And I will also be available if asked to give my impression of its progress.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:16.480
Well, of course, we'll want your, shall we say, your editorship at all points in the development.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.680
That will be, of course, always available.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.360
Always available.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:31.520
Yes, just one last thing.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:43.440
Now from our earlier conversations I gathered that of course the primary function of my

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:53.340
my wife's and my life and the Aitkin's as well, is to fulfill a spiritual purpose and to not

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.360
only grow and develop ourselves but also to assist others.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:07.600
Now if this is so, then it would not, you know, the matter of material inconvenience or monetary

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.600
inconvenience in the greater scheme of things is fairly unimportant.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.600
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.600
I do, but you see, you will never be abandoned in this regard.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:27.600
You know, if you consider the Divine Forces as an employer,

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.600
you will never fail to receive your paycheck.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.600
If you do.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:51.040
The slightest amount of work you do on our behalf will be returned, rewarded, so much

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.920
more than you can imagine, sir.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:02.120
The reason I ask is I detected your concern, which of course I appreciate, for the potential

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:09.120
problems involved for us in doing this. But I just wanted a reaffirmation that, as I understand

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.000
it, at this point, given our earlier conversations, one should not be too concerned about this

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.220
type of problem because the important thing is to do the work that one has been expected

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.400
and has agreed to do.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.240
I think you have made a very perceptive statement and I would like to say that if you follow

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:34.240
through with this plan and do put yourselves to any inconvenience. Most of it will lie

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:43.240
with you, sir, because your life is extremely complicated and it will be a sacrifice of

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:52.240
a sort on your part to travel the distances, especially for just a limited period of time.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.740
May I just say that we would be grateful if you would attempt it,

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:04.240
and I think you're very wise to put aside all other considerations of any kind,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.740
at least for a period of months, to see how it works out for you.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.740
Do you see, as it moves, the movement of it will tell you

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.740
whether it is something that you are harmonious with and that you agree with

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.740
and that you want to continue participation in.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.740
I understand that you've answered my question. Thank you.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:30.740
And any time it would not be convenient for them to come to Socorro, we can always come to Santa Fe.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:38.740
That would be helpful if there could be some kind of a dual movement so that they will not always have to be traveling,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:45.740
because their lives are quite, you know, complicated with offspring and various duties,

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.740
and the gentleman has many commitments of various kinds that are very important.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.740
No problem for us, that would be very helpful.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:58.740
We have a message for you, sir.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.740
Oh, yes.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:17.740
Justin?

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.740
Yes, Master.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:32.740
I come to place my hands upon your head

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:39.740
in gratitude for the efforts that you have made

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.740
on behalf of the one in the last few weeks.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:53.820
And I wish with this placement on your head to remove all doubts in your mind that you

00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:01.420
may have had in the last weeks as to your ability to follow my instructions.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.420
Have there been doubts?

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.420
Is this a correct statement?

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.420
Yes, I have had considerable doubts.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.420
Yes, I am panicking considerably now.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:15.420
I am here to place my hand on your head and state that we are aware of the difficulties

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:22.420
that you have had to go through in the last weeks to rise at the early hour under tremendously

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.420
difficult circumstances.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.420
And we are very grateful.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.420
And I come to tell you that my heart is pleased.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:42.420
Well, Master, if you are pleased, then I am pleased also, and I shall continue with whatever you ask me to do.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:58.420
There is nothing now, other than what you do, that I would ask of you, except one thing.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.420
Yes, Master.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:08.420
In so much as it is possible during your day, keep me in your mind and heart.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.420
May I ask you a question about this?

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.420
Perhaps your question is, in what form?

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.420
This is the question.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:34.420
The form at this time should simply be a feeling tone.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.420
Do you understand me?

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.420
I do understand.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:42.420
At a later date there will be a visual contact made,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:47.420
and then you will have no questions along this line.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.420
But this is not the time for that.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:56.420
It will come and I do promise you that it will come.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.420
Thank you, Master.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:07.420
I'm grateful that you have seen fit to inform me of these things.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:13.420
You are my son and I am well pleased.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.420
Thank you, Master.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:28.740
Are there any other questions?

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.260
You have any other suggestions?

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:43.180
No Bartholomew, that takes care of my concern at this time.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:54.700
We have, as you know, Bartholomew, started a centering group in Socorro with about 10 or

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:02.700
12 people, and we have set up a schedule of which you may be aware, and would like to ask

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.180
whether you have any other suggestions for the management of this program.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.180
No.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.940
No, indeed, we're watching with great joy.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.860
Everything seems to be moving beautifully.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.460
The movements that we perceive, of course, are not the same outer movements that you

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.460
perceive.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.700
And what we see is a very tight, binding network moving amongst those.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.660
Don't be overly concerned, either of you, please, when people come and go, even in these

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:38.060
early stages, because out of this there will form a very tight reticulata.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:48.300
And it is through that that there will become significant changes in the being of the people

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.140
who choose to stay.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.140
So no, we're delighted.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:57.720
In fact, it's going far better than we had hoped at the beginning.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.300
Their response has been on a much deeper level.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.620
And we're very, very – I'm not speaking of all of them, of course, but the core group

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:12.620
that we have been interested in working is coming together nicely and it's very fine.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:18.620
Yes, I felt very warm about the whole project.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:24.620
Excuse me, but I think the light bothers the woman, the flashlight.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.620
How about that, is that alright?

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.620
Fine.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:45.620
You have used the term "salvation" on a couple of occasions, and I wonder if you could give us, from your point of view, what this word might mean, the idea, the concept.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:54.620
Well, this is one of those very difficult things to explain, but I'll do my best.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.740
First of all, on the highest level, there is no one to be saved and there is nothing to

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.700
save anybody from.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:10.020
But that is a very fine and lofty statement and indeed there will come a time when all

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.460
of you in this room will deeply understand this as an experience rather than as an intellectual

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:22.100
statement. But until the time that you are entered into that level of awareness, it is

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:30.820
more helpful perhaps to speak especially to the Christian aspect. This is a Christian

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:41.620
term, and the reason that salvation is used, the word means literally to lift them up out

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:47.580
of what they have been living in and lift them into a different state.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:52.340
This is literally what we mean when we speak of salvation.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:58.780
There is nothing to be saved in the sense of a condemned and evil soul.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.420
There is none of this feeling at all.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:11.500
It is simply, in our words, to save one from an illusion, to remove them from their dream,

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.260
to wake them up and move them to the loftier spheres

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:21.420
from which they can then look upon what has come before

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:27.180
in their life cycle and realize the tremendous depth of light and movement

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.700
that has always been there but that they didn't see it.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.700
So this is the way salvation is really meant.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.900
And when people say that they are saved,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.660
for example, there is a very definite movement

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.420
throughout not only America but through Europe and so forth,

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.300
of the so-called "born-again" people,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.860
the "born-again" Christian.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.860
What happens to a "born-again" Christian

00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:00.020
is literally they are lifted up out of themselves for a while.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.660
The power builds up

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:08.100
and then lifts them up out of their state

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.460
that they were in a moment before.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.260
It is such a tremendously jolting,

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.380
vitalizing, rejuvenating experience

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.140
that it seems to them to have been born again,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.300
literally, it is like moving into a new world.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.100
And that is precisely what we hope for.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.100
You see, the more people on the earth plane

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:35.020
who can become born again in whatever religion they choose,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.060
to wake up in whatever religion they choose.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.940
This is what we need.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.740
And for the Christian, it comes in the terminology

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.580
of being born again.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.260
And then salvation, in this terminology,

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:54.220
would simply mean a sustained state of born-again feeling.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.740
Do you understand me?

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.660
That the feelings, this tremendous uplift,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.380
which this gentleman has not too long ago experienced,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.220
am I right?

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.380
- That's right.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:12.580
this feeling on a continuing, ever going, on living basis is what salvation really is.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:18.700
And sir, you would, I think, agree, well, let me put it this way, would you agree that

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:24.460
having that feeling for the rest of your life would be considered a saving?

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.060
This is what we mean, that the upliftment would be in a continuous form.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.620
Yes, thank you.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:39.180
You gave a very beautiful dissertation on the Christ teachings.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.460
Very pleased that it had meaning.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.180
And it has been very meaningful to a number of people.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:52.540
I wonder if you or some of your associates could give a similar dissertation on the Buddha's

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.980
teachings and his place in the world of today, perhaps.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.340
We would be pleased to do this.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.860
But I can't do it.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.860
So if the woman could have some water, I think we will be able to.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.860
Okay.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:13.140
It is not that I cannot, it is just that it is always best to call in those that know

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.140
the subject best.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:22.900
The Christ and the Buddha are identical.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:31.020
On one level higher, there is no Christ and no Buddha.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:39.340
But in order to speak with a practical tongue, in order to make things understandable to

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.060
those that are requesting, we would say this.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:54.060
In the cycles of the Earth, as we observe it, at different times there are different needs.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:07.180
It is our job to do our best to bring forth the pulsating force that is most needed at

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.500
that time of Earth cycle.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:18.500
At this time, as I believe has already been discussed, the emphasis is being placed on

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500
the Christ.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:32.860
However, it is not to be thought for any moment that the Buddha and the force that is embodied

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:44.300
in that concept is not one of the most dynamic, creative, vitalizing and helpful forces of

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.140
the earth plane.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:54.100
There is very little need to speak to any of you about the Buddha himself, the persona

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:59.140
that we call the Buddha.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:10.440
The tremendous advantage for Buddhists is that the documentation of what he actually said

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.540
is extremely accurate.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:18.620
This is not true in the case of the Christian doctrines.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:28.180
Various key phrases that are quoted as being Christian are not directly quoted in an absolute

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:35.180
correct sense. They have been changed, they have been infused with meaning that was not

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:45.780
there at the beginning, and therefore there is a great misunderstanding that arises in

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:55.180
the Christian doctrine. This does not happen in the case of the Buddha. The main reason

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:03.700
is that the wording was carefully remembered and documented at the time. Do you follow?

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.700
Yes.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:14.700
Now this was not true in the Christian drama. The documents were written at a later time

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:21.700
and much had been imagined and hoped and therefore some of it is not accurate.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:29.700
Therefore, some of it is not a crystal reflection of truth.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:39.700
But, for the discerning Christian, the light will reveal itself.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.700
But, in the case of the Buddha,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.700
the power that emanated from that one figure

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:57.700
has changed and will continue to change the hearts of mankind.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.700
The primary importance of the Buddha

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.700
is that he dealt with the breaking of the illusion

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:19.400
And it is this that is the highest form of the Buddhist teaching.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:28.300
The ritual and all of that is very helpful to some and should not be in any way negated,

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:35.100
but the essence of the teaching is the breaking of the illusion.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:42.700
There is one mind, and the Buddha knew there was one mind,

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.500
and his whole teaching points to this one truth.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.740
There are many branches of his tree.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:59.900
They are all, if sincerely followed, they are all

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:08.900
absolutely to be trusted, and if followed, will bring the fruits that he was able to bring forth.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:21.900
However, we must in truth say that the Buddha, as in the Christ, was not a normal human being,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:30.900
and the heights to which he reached are not easily accessible to most of you.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.900
Do you understand?

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.900
Yes.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.900
Yes.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.900
And therefore we would ask that you do your very best,

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:44.900
but do not be overly concerned with the inability to achieve that highest fruit,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.900
because if you could but know the, in your terms,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:57.900
In the long terms, eons of time that the Buddha spent seeking one mind,

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:04.900
you would realize that there is a long way for most humans to go.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:12.900
But it is equally true to say that it will, if persevered in,

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:21.060
it will take you to great and high branches on the Buddha tree of life.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.900
Do you have a specific question?

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:32.420
I was thinking about the application of the Buddhist principles today.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.140
I quoted to you one, or to Bartholomew one time about

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.380
Arnold Toynbee's statement that the inner penetration of the two religions was the

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.380
most important event. How would you respond to that?

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:57.380
Well, I was present at the time of the other giving of the statement, and I am in agreement,

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:04.260
total agreement with what was said. I sense here, perhaps this is not so, but I sense a

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:11.260
I have a question about one particular branch of this tree, which is the Zen branch.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.260
Yes.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.260
Would you like to speak about this?

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.260
Yes, I would, very much.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.260
This is the most difficult of the branches.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.260
It is difficult in that it is austere,

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.260
All goes according to the higher plan.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.260
All will work so that a school will be formed around...

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.260
that all four of these will participate.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.260
And you see they're all four teachers in various lines of endeavor.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.260
They all have taught.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.260
So a school of some kind will be formed.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:55.260
It's our hope that it will be a school for, what shall we call it,

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.260
the new age teaching.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:04.260
believe is what they say, but that type of thing that will also give the regular curriculum.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:11.580
And these four will be very instrumental in the setting up of a community, much along

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:18.660
the line of Finhorn, which would be of interest to you perhaps, but not exactly, but generally

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:24.980
along those lines. And these four will form the nucleus of something that will turn into

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:31.980
be quite a significant movement in that area. But it won't be for a few years yet. There

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:38.140
are certain things that have to be done first and certain lessons and certain furtherings

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:45.140
and then it will happen. But it will take place, yes. That is a valid question.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:53.140
Another question. All her life the woman has felt that this mediumistic work is of a lower

00:45:53.140 --> 00:46:00.140
order of service. Would you comment on this please?

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.540
We understand how she feels about this.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.980
Her training has been extremely rigorous in the more severe disciplines, as you know,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.980
where austerity and such have been the focus of her development.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:27.180
and she is very much drawn to Zen Buddhism, which as you know, does not participate in this type of belief structure.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:34.180
The thing that she needs to understand and to make a part of her very fiber is that

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:40.180
the mind can decide to do certain things, can see itself in a certain way.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:46.180
And that is well and good, the mind has the right to do creation in this way.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.180
However, when one turns one's life over to the divine force,

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:57.180
then one must decide to be obedient to whatever comes as one's destiny to do,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:05.180
and to put aside as much as possible any ideas of greater or lesser degrees of work.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.180
Everyone is called to do a different work,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:14.180
and everyone must do the best of their ability to fulfill that particular destiny.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.860
You know, I believe it's written in one of your books on this plane

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.580
that it's better to do one's own job perfectly,

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.340
no matter how small the job, than another person's job, however grand.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.980
Something along that line.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:33.540
This is very much the essence of what I feel most human beings need to understand.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.420
You see, the reason that she is very doubtful

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.220
is that she realizes there will be negativity given to her for this,

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:49.900
and that many people look on this kind of service as being of a lower order.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:56.220
But in all honesty, she must scan her past life and ask herself

00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:01.660
at how many junctures in her own life have people doing the service that she is now performing,

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.460
how many people have helped her along the way.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:10.220
And you see, she has had some very traumatic experiences take place in her life,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:18.220
And at each juncture, there has been in the offing someone who was willing to lay themselves down in order to serve.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.220
And this is what she's doing, you see. This is something very few people understand.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:33.220
A really highly attuned, mediumistic expression calls for the person to lay their life down,

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:38.220
literally lay their life down, in order to serve someone else.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:45.220
If she could see it from this perception, I think she will be a little more relieved about the situation.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.220
Have I made that clear to all of you?

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.220
Yes, very clear.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.220
And I feel that this is something that's greatly misunderstood.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.220
Now, let us be clear on this.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:49:04.220
It's a very easy medium to misuse, you see, and therefore the entire process comes into question.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:11.380
and many people use it for profit and use it for power and use it for manipulation and for an ego satisfaction.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.720
These elements are not present in the woman

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:21.480
and she must just make up her mind to view the entire situation from this level.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:27.120
As she heard this weekend, a very fine saying was given that I think is worth repeating,

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.680
which is "keep the high watch."

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.180
You know, that's a very fine and meaningful truth. Keep the high watch.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:39.080
And she was very much taken with these words and I think they speak to her.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.480
And if you would let her understand it from this level.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.880
Yes. Thank you.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.880
Alright. May I just speak to you and we'll see how things work.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.580
I would like to say first that you are a very high soul.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:03.580
I would like to say that you have suffered much in various emotional situations during this lifetime

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:15.080
and we would like to commend you on your very deep and truly loving response to life as it has been presented to you.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.580
It has not gone unnoticed.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:24.080
We understand the deep sincerity of your call and of your understanding

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:31.980
and we stand ready at any time to be of service in any way,

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:36.180
your way will be greatly lightened in the ensuing years.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.280
Much of the deepest heartbreak of your life is finished.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:50.380
And all we can say is, "Well done. Well done. Well done."

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.380
Do you understand what we're trying to say?

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.380
Yep.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:51:03.380
Because there are not many on the earth plane who respond to life situations the way you have done.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.380
Well done.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.380
Are you aware of the tremendous light you carry?

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.380
I wonder. I perceive you probably are not.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:19.380
So, let me share with you how I perceive you when I do this.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:27.380
If you could envision in your mind, let us say, a yellow flower.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:39.380
A yellow flower that radiates the warmth and the love and the life force and the sustenance that moves through the very air that it lives in.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:46.380
This is the kind of symbol that is brought into one's mind when one looks upon the one in a deeper sense.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:52:07.380
Because truly that is what you do, you know, you radiate out, your very face carries the feeling of understanding that comes through deep living and living through difficulties that would not happen to so many whose faces would either turn blank or whose face would turn to sorrow.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:19.380
but you see yours has not, and yours radiates this inner substance that we would like to tell you that we perceive and that you do not perceive.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.380
And perhaps, if we might make a suggestion, may we?

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.380
Yes.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:33.940
It is extremely important that you work in these remaining years of your life to concentrate

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.940
on the acceptance of this very fact that we're now speaking of.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:45.220
I'm not speaking of accepting your ego station in life, I'm speaking of accepting your radiant

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.940
station in life, which is a golden one.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:55.580
You have let others take the forward seat for many, many years in your life.

00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:02.340
In various ways you have deferred to others and allowed this to be the way in which you related to the world.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:09.380
And this is all well and good, because it teaches you the deep lessons of humility

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:14.820
that so many of the people that have gone before you as forerunners have not learned.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:20.660
But the thing that is now necessary before you cross over into the next plane of existence,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.740
the thing that you need to develop and carry with you,

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:33.940
is this tremendous light must really become a light in your mind so that you actually perceive it.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.420
I don't know your name. Could you tell me your name?

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:36.980
Virginia.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.540
Virginia.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:46.540
Virginia, you need to understand that your mind is radiant and you are now capable, I

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:55.820
would even say easily capable, of truly understanding that light. Even so far as to see it, to really

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:02.860
perceive it in its pulsating form. So all that is really necessary to just completely

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.500
light in the heart center to remove all of the heaviness that life has given to you,

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:15.540
to remove that and to radiate forth the light and the peace that is just so close to you,

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:22.380
is to turn your mind truly to acceptance of this one central fact which you have not been

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.380
able to accept about yourself.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:32.380
You are the truth and you are the light and you carry it in very glowing amounts.

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.380
And there's so much more so than so many that I have looked upon on the earth plane.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.380
So I would ask you on behalf of the Brotherhood, now please understand,

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:50.380
we're calling at this time for all souls who really wish to serve, I mean really serve,

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.380
to call, to come forth if they can.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:58.380
So I'm asking you to consider, if you would please,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.380
not to do this for your own self,

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.380
although you will be greatly helped,

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.380
but if you cannot do it for yourself,

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.380
would you consider doing it for others?

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.380
Because ones who carry the light in the quantity that you do,

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.380
you're so close to being able to share it.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.380
And this is exactly what we need, Virginia,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.380
people to share the light, you see?

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.380
Everyone has light, you see?

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.380
I mean, this is the facts of existence.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.380
Everyone has light, but so few are willing to share it.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:37.380
And you're so close to that point when it will just spread throughout the whole environment in which you live

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:43.380
and move outwards past your environment, past the place of your work, past all of these things.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.380
You're so close.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.380
And this is what we need so much.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:52.380
This is... so, have I made it clear of what I'm asking?

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:57.380
Nothing is demanded, you know. We cannot demand of anyone nor would we dream of doing so,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:04.380
but we simply extend the offer. Please give it consideration, if you would.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.380
Have you any questions now?

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:16.380
At times when you will be tempted to go into a lesser state,

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.380
please recall,

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.380
please recall,

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.380
that what you're perceiving in the darkness is an illusion.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380
It does not exist.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.380
It does not exist, Virginia.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.380
It is very difficult for humans on the earth plane to really understand this,

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.380
but you're very close to that understanding, so I share with you now.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:37.380
It is an illusion.

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:42.380
It is simply a projected illusion and does not have to bind you at all.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.380
And you do not have to be bound.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.380
You are one of the truly gifted ones.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.380
You don't have to be bound.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.380
In normal phraseology, your so-called karmic load...

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.380
You're familiar with all this?

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.380
Your karmic load is pretty much paid off.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:09.380
So that means that now you can turn to this otherness within yourself and move through that.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.380
And all of these things will disappear as if illusions.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.380
People who cannot respond and who the light is too much for, if their ego is too attached,

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.380
they will move out of your life and it will be easy for you to let them go.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:30.380
And you will be brought people who will be willing and desiring to share your strengths with you.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:40.380
So, the first and only call is please to recognize that there is a light within that is available for you to perceive.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:45.380
And you can perceive it in many ways. Various people do it in various ways.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:50.380
Some actually see it, some actually feel it, some actually feel the rising of the light,

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:56.380
some people feel the moving out of the light, some people are enclosed with a vibration that actually stirs them,

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.820
Some people hear music, there are many forms.

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:05.420
All such forms are a manifestation of what is always there but rarely perceived.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.620
But your tuning device is ready.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.820
You're ready to receive it.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.420
So, please give it thought.

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:20.420
Then the woman has another question that I think is of interest to all of us.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.820
What is a proper understanding of prayer and how best to use it?

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.820
It's a good question.

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:36.820
And like all really fine questions, it has to be answered on different levels because

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.820
there are different ears to hear and different hearts to respond.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.820
So we will start with the lowest and move on to the higher realms.

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:57.260
At the very lowest form of prayer, it is a way of the human vehicle to remind oneself

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:04.260
to actually put into a verbal pattern something that they're deeply feeling inside themselves.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:12.380
You see, every human being, I care not how seemingly, and that is a true statement, seemingly

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:19.380
low and degraded that person is, actually every movement is an actual desire to commune.

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:25.380
You know, every time a human being seeks to commune with another human being, either through

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:33.380
speech, or through touch, or through sex, or through writing, whatever vehicle that this

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:39.380
is taking, the real desire is to be one with them.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:44.380
Now we specialize this, you see, and break it down into male/female. That is the biggest.

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:50.380
If there is one illusion that the human will hang on until the very end, it is that.

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:54.380
They enjoy more than any other this tremendous play between male/female.

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.380
They really enjoy it.

00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:03.380
So this is why it is the hardest of the so-called illusions to break out of.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:25.380
Because in a specialized, when you take the incredible force of pulsating love that moves through the universe and try to ellipse it down into two bodies and say, "I will love this one and this one must love me," you see, it is actually a very painful, it is literally a painful situation.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:38.380
Do you see what I'm saying? You're taking the vastness and you're moving it into very small cylinders and saying, "These I will love, but I will not love those," you see?

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:46.380
And this very pressure that keeps you so compacted into just loving certain people, you know,

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:55.380
is an incredibly limiting expression of love force, because in actuality, the person who truly loves, loves everybody.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:01.380
There is absolutely no difference between loving this one and that one and that one and that one.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.380
There is no difference. The person who truly loves knows this, that love is.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:11.140
is. Love is not something you do to someone. Love is a state that you have entered into

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:18.140
and therefore is shared with everyone, you see. But the male/female illusion is the greatest.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:23.520
Alright, back to the prayer situation. The human is seeking another vehicle, usually

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.520
another personification to commune with. You see, we try it on the earth plane, often it

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.820
doesn't work. Well, we agree. But often times on the earth plane, trying to love another

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.940
human being can be very difficult. The other person either doesn't respond the way we wish

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:45.540
or the person dies or whatever. There are so many things that can happen in a relationship

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:52.060
on the earth plane. So people then, when these do not turn out to give them the sustenance

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.220
that they really wish for, then they turn to the next level. And that next level is

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.820
a personification of a deity. I don't care which one it is, you can pick from the whole

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.020
roster, do you understand that? Whichever one you choose to pick, that is the one then,

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:13.720
now you take this and you try to make this correspondence between yourself and this deity.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.980
And prayer is the method of love making, if you will, you see. This is the love making

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:24.020
then, because you can't touch them, you can't make love to them, so what's left? You can

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.020
talk to them, so you do, and the more you talk to them, the more you pour out your being

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:34.340
to them, the more you can sit in silence and receive the word, you will receive. You see,

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:41.340
it does work. Make no mistake, it works. Okay? This is why it has gone on through the ages.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:47.660
When people speak in deprecating terms about prayer, the thing that they have not really

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:53.380
gotten in touch with is the fact that it works, and it works beautifully. But the one problem

01:02:53.380 --> 01:03:00.380
with most on the earth plane is they do all the talking and they need to do some of the

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.780
listening you see. It's a one way communication and it won't work. It's just like a man and

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.140
wife. If the man is yelling at the woman all the time and doing all the talking, there's

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:16.500
no real relationship you see. A real relationship only comes when both are given equal time if

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:23.260
you will and if both are being in a totally receptive feeling of listening. So prayer works

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:30.260
best when it is equally divided between speaking and listening, or if you wish to put it another

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:39.780
way, reaching out and taking in. You see, both of these movements are very important. Now,

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:47.700
to some people this form is inadequate. They do not enjoy, I do not mean to exclude you

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.980
but I can't keep turning. Do you understand?

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.980
Yes, I do.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.980
Um, um, the...

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.980
Many people do not respond to this

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.980
because they, uh, get into difficulty with the form.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.980
Or many people will begin with the form

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.980
and then feel, "No, this is too restricting."

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.980
Just as they found it was too restricting,

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.980
say, on the Earth plane with the male-female relationship,

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.980
now the relationship with the Deity becomes too restricting, you see.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:21.620
you see. So what is left? Well, they don't really know what's left, but they have found

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:27.580
a magic secret, which is that calling out brings a response. So then they say, "All

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.820
right." Now, I don't say they consciously say this, I'm just saying that the mechanism

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:39.140
then moves into another area, which says, "I will call out to," usually now, they will

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:46.140
personify as a God. You see, they've moved from Buddha or Christ or Shiva or Krishna

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:52.620
or whatever, you see, from this deity, they will move then to the source of all deity

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:58.940
which in their mind usually has a word, you know, to the Buddhist perhaps they would call

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:05.060
it the Buddha mind, to the Christian they would call it God, to the Mohammed they would

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:11.500
called Allah. You see, there will be a word then that will move in. Now, when they move

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:18.500
into this new realm, the same law applies. You see, the same law applies as it does on

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:24.580
the human level to best communicate, the same law applies on the highest level. Now we move

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:31.580
into the total communication with the God Self, with the Source of all things. And what

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:41.540
What we attempt to do when we do that is to literally join our total being with that vast

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.540
source.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.780
That is what we're trying to do.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.980
And some make it, it's possible to do it.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:54.420
In fact, to tell you the truth, it's easier to do than most people would believe.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.940
And they don't wish to believe it because then it would call on them to really try for

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940
it.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:04.100
Most human beings don't really want to try for it because you see this final stage is

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.780
the hardest in one way.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.860
There is only one source.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.620
If you join with that source, there is only one source.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.820
You cannot keep your special separateness and be a part of that one source.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.640
You cannot do it.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.460
And it asks there the total question as you stand there beginning and as you feel the vast

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:34.060
movement, what happens is you feel, actually within your physical vehicle, you feel this

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:42.060
movement, this tremendous movement, and you sense instantly that everything will be different.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:48.340
You see, you can stay pretty much the same on the level below that of the deity worship,

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:54.220
you see. You can stay yourself as worshipping that. There's two of you, correct? And there's

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:59.020
a lot of satisfaction in that. But, and that's a familiar territory, but when we move to the

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:06.020
higher section, when we really decide to immerse ourselves, it calls on a very different quality.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:13.980
And this is why so few really move all the way through in this last human reaching out.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:22.780
Because as you reach out to be immersed yourself in the One, if you ask continually, "Take

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:29.780
me in, let me surrender, let me be yours, it will happen. And the closer you get, the more

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:36.780
you understand that. The closer you get to losing that sense of I, of small I, the closer

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:44.100
you get, the more afraid you will become and many people turn back at this stage. But I

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:51.220
would ask all people who really do approach this, who get to that stage in their development

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.220
where they really do want to give it all away,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.220
just give it all away,

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.720
if they would only...

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.420
Oh, how can I say?

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.820
In the moment of receiving,

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.720
when one is beginning to get into one's communion

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.020
with the Source or the God or whatever,

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.120
when one is really receiving,

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:20.520
you will feel the incredible trust

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.840
that you can place in this process.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.000
You see, you will never be left without that knowing.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.760
It is only if you don't listen, if you don't watch for it,

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.040
if you don't get in touch with that, then you become afraid.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.800
But you cannot really stay afraid for very long

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.640
if you will keep calling on and then listening for

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.240
and receiving and holding within your being that vibrational note.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.840
Do you know what I'm speaking of?

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:55.200
There is an incredible peace and joy and love and protection that is actually, totally felt

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.320
by the great ones who decide to immerse themselves.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.760
Without that, they would never be able to do it.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.520
You see, they could never do it.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.200
You see, you're not left alone.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.760
Never, never, never are you left alone.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.120
The human being reflects the world.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.520
They see separateness.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.040
They see being abandoned.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.560
They see that the love that they have is left, the love that they have is dead, their children

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.300
die, all these things happen and they believe that to be the reality.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:27.480
So we say, do not count on your eyes, alright?

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.060
Don't trust your eyes, your eyes will deceive you, always.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.060
Your eyes are not the vehicle to see truth with.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:38.560
The inner mechanism is the vehicle to feel and experience truth with.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.820
Those who go this path will be people who spend hours in this communion.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.560
I mean in the midst of their work will be commuting.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.720
You see, you don't have to be, you know, locked in a cell to do this commuting.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.120
It can be a constant, ever-present, ever-vitalizing, ever-moving thing.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.620
Yes.

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.960
Have I made this clear?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.720
Very good.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.120
Thank you.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:15.120
Do you have any suggestions on how we can come more close to this ultimate surrender?

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.120
Thank you.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.120
There's only one rule. Desire it.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:32.120
Desire it first, second, third, fifth, thousandth, on up.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:40.120
If it is your first and your greatest desire, if it pulsates through your being with the desire, you will not lose it.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:49.120
You cannot be refused. But half-hearted desires, "This moment I want it, and then the next moment I don't."

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:55.120
You see, it's this fluctuating of desire that so defeats the victory.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.120
So the only thing, and how then to achieve this one-pointedness?

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.120
Very simple, work at it.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.120
You see, it's like everything else that you ever do.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120
How do you become a doctor? You work at it.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.120
You work at it.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.120
And this is how you achieve what you would choose to call enlightenment,

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
what I call freedom.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.120
You see, you become free by working at it.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.120
The books have been written, everyone in this room knows the rules.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:29.120
rules, you see. There aren't any of us that don't know the rules. We know. Everyone in

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.120
the vast universe knows the rules of all of the things that they're asked to do. And the

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:40.120
human being knows the rules under which he should operate in order to move into this state.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.120
But you have to work at it. And people are lazy. Do you know that, sir? Human beings are

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:52.120
are very lazy and they can get the momentum going for certain things, you see, and it

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:59.680
differs with each person. But pretty soon that becomes old and jaded and tiring. You

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.920
know, even the great millionaires, if you speak with them, you will find that this great movement

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.480
for great money becomes a jaded affair and then something else takes its place, you see.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.480
and this is true of the intellectual, you know, at one point they become tired with burning,

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:22.480
this burning mind and so forth, and the ledger becomes very bored with bodies soon,

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.480
eventually somewhere down the line they're all the same, the experience is the same,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.480
and is that all there is? You see, no matter where you take it, eventually it becomes a dead,

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:38.480
a dead life, because in truth it is dead. The thing that makes life worth, eternally worth living

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.480
is that quest that we're speaking of.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.480
So, just work for it.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480
And be aware of one thing,

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.480
which many people perhaps are not aware of.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.480
I think we have spoken of this before,

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.480
but I would repeat it again in this instance,

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.480
which I feel is an important thing.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.480
For every movement that you make,

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.480
please be aware,

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.480
an incredible amount of movement is made toward you.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:11.480
toward you. You see, it is all done out of love. The love is a pulsating reality that

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:19.320
is so crowding in upon your consciousness that sometimes we marvel that your brains don't

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:26.320
erupt with it. It is just a constant, real reality pushing on your very selves because

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.440
this is what you're made of. You see, if you were to see what you really are, you are light

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.440
and you are love. That is what you are.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.440
And anything else that you perceive, I care not how high you go,

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:48.440
you can see the greatest, the highest diva, the greatest god that ever lived in a form,

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.440
the highest vision you will ever see is light and love moving in total harmony,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.440
and it is everywhere. You see? It is everywhere.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.440
That would be the significance of the Buddhist wisdom and compassion.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.440
Wisdom being light, compassion representing love.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.440
Exactly. These things move and they move together.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.440
They move in harmony. You see, because one without the other has no meaning.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.440
The two of them must move and they do move. They are absolutely one of a whole.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.440
This is why the best couples often represent both aspects.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.440
the mind and the wisdom in one and the love and the compassion in the other.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.440
And because then you see they can make the exchange, they can learn one from the other.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.440
Neither of them is the more desirable trait.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.440
It's simply they will have a better mirror to reflect back, you see.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.440
And this is one thing that the women in the world...

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.440
You see, I hope that this will not be taken ill by some of the people who might hear this tape,

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.960
this tape, but the fact remains that the woman's chief job and the reason that one takes a

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:03.960
female body is to learn gentleness and compassion. These are the two true deep hallmarks of the

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:12.440
female. Gentleness, which goes understanding. You cannot be truly gentle unless you're

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:20.240
really loving. These two have to go together. And compassion then for everyone, I mean everyone,

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:29.240
and a woman, you see you choose what vehicle you will manifest in according to what weaknesses that you have not yet brought to fruition.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:41.240
So you know this is very funny from our perception all of this tremendous push for women's rights in a sense is very humorous from our view of things

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:48.240
of things because so many of these people who are doing the lavish shouting have come precisely

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:53.400
in the female form so that they could learn the very attributes that they are so furious

01:15:53.400 --> 01:16:01.840
that they're funny about, you see. Because one thing that every human being needs to

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:10.080
know, I care not, you can incarnate a thousand times and if you have not learned this one

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:17.080
attribute you will have to come back. And that is this ability to be a follower. No one will

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:23.200
reach the Godhead without being a follower. No one. And if everybody is leading, if everyone

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.640
is the boss, if everyone is in control, then there leaves nobody to learn these incredibly

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:35.280
beautiful lessons of how to be a follower. How to just absolutely be willing and joyfully

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.400
a follower, there's a tremendous amount of joy in being a follower. It's a tremendous,

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.400
you know, it's just unrealistic. So, I hope I've made that clear.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.400
Like our old saying, too many chiefs and not many Indians.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.200
Not many Indians. There are many more chiefs on the earth plane right now than there are

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.800
Indians, I assure you of that. And the sad thing is that many of them have come to, that

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.000
came, took on body form to be Indians. But the pull, you see, the tremendous pull of the

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.080
society, especially in the West, the tremendous emphasis that's bombarding

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.520
from everywhere, success lies in the powerful. You see? It comes from

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.560
everywhere. Whoever has the power is the success. This is not the truth. May I just

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.800
say this is not a true perception. Many of the people who carry the power stand

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.440
in great jeopardy. Many people who carry the power in the world as it is

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.120
structured today are in jeopardy because it is false. They are building on a very

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.220
a false basis of power.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:36.220
True power, true power comes from total surrender,

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:42.260
of total giving over, of total reception,

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.540
and of total love.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.080
The person who is the strongest in the world

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.820
is the person who loves totally,

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.700
who will accept anything and everyone

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.960
in every moment of their life.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.960
That person is most beloved and most fortunate.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:06.960
It has been a privilege.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:13.960
And if you have any other words of advice for me or any of the others in the room at this time,

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960
they would be appreciated.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.960
Well, we can try for it.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.960
I think we should ask the two guests if they would really like to participate in this

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960
or that they would not.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.460
to

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:26.960
and

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.040
