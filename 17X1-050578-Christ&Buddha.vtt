00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
5th of May 1978 and the beginning of a session with Bartholomew in Socorro, New Mexico.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You didn't count, you were waiting for the count.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Good evening.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Good evening, Bartholomew.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We're pleased that you're here with us this evening.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have long awaited this opportunity to speak with you

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and are very pleased that you chose to be with us tonight.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, thank you. It is a great pleasure to be here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We sense...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We sense some deep questioning in you, sir, and we'll proceed whenever you are ready.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Very good. I do have a number I would like to ask, the first of which would be...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Would you come up closer to the microphone so that it can be on the tape?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Yes. Could you speak on the question of the purpose and the role of the Christ and the Christ's teachings

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
teachings in God's plan for mankind and his evolution.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:44.280
Well, there is so much of course, but we shall try to respond to what we sense are your deep

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.040
questions. Would you exchange places with this gentleman?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Certainly.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.040
It works best if I can speak in your direction.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:09.320
We will, the question is vast, so we will limit it to what we feel are the deep quests within your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.320
consciousness if that is all right with you.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.800
Excellent.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.080
First it is, I'm sure, very obvious to you as you look back upon

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.400
your life that although you have tried to deviate

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.600
at one time or another into other streams

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.360
(snow crunching)

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
(clippers whirring)

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720
I think that'll be all right.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720
Do we proceed?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720
Yes. Sorry.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720
The color of the flow is blue.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.720
Each of the great forces

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720
that you call

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.720
religious institutions,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720
religious sciences,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720
whatever, carry a color.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720
And in the case of the Christ

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720
flow, it is a very deep

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720
and vibrant blue.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.720
This is an interesting

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:40.700
for you in that I would suspect that you have had experiences throughout your

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.440
lifetime that may harmonize with this color. Is this a true statement? This is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.920
very true. So all these years as you pull yourself to and fro in an attempt to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.160
find the center of your quest, you go off and then you return once again.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.160
and this is a wise selection in your case, sir, because the way of the Christ is your way.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And, now this is not true, of course, of "Say this, gentlemen, on my right."

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.160
But, so all of this is mostly directed at you this evening, this section of the table.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:35.280
The place of the Christ in the world, as far as a religious force, at this time, the Christ

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.400
is taking the first place, the greatest place, the strongest place, because it is the current

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.040
that is most needed at this time.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.400
The current of the Christ represents the current of the greatest love.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.080
I am speaking of the deepest forces of love that are manifest within the universe.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.840
And it is the Christ flow that most represents this particular strain.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.360
Let us take, for example, the strain of the Buddha.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.200
Now the Buddha represents a different flow, it is a different force.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.360
The earth is in a cyclical movement and at this time the cyclical movement is toward

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.800
the deep need for greater love.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.400
Do you understand?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.900
And this is why this particular force, this particular vehicle is being used.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:43.000
This explains by the way the great upsurgence of the Christian, what they call the Christian

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.040
Church, the charismatic movements that are sweeping not only the United States but various

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.340
parts of Europe.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:58.040
It is because the need is so desperately great at this time for the human vehicle to develop

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.400
the, what we would call, the heart situation.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.880
And therefore, the reason that the Christ moves into the forefront at this time is that

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:17.480
this is the greatest strength of his teaching.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.840
What particular strain of this would you like to deal with?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.200
The subject is vast.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:32.000
Well I was thinking in terms of the Christ teaching that no one comes to the Father except

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
by me.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.640
Could you interpret that?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:47.540
Alright, now, when the historic Christ spoke those words, he was speaking from a reality

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:54.160
of the moment to the people that were gathered around him, and it was a literal truth.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:02.200
The hope of what was to become their salvation depended entirely on him, on his words, on

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.720
what he would say, literally their salvation depended upon that. It is equally true to

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.040
say that millions of people throughout the world who are incarnate now and have been in

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.520
the past and will be in the future, their only means of salvation are through his words.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:30.400
The reason is, sir, that within each entity incarnate there is a certain tuning quality,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:39.240
a certain responsiveness that responds to a certain vibration. And when he said, "No one

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.640
comes to the Father except by me," whoever hears those words and feels a resounding vibration

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.640
within their being, that is the absolute and valid truth for that person.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.320
Now it may be that another person standing next to this individual hears the same phrase

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.240
and it falls as if on deaf ears.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.020
The reason is that there is within that other entity

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.760
another vibrational force that speaks equally,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.240
deeply and purposefully to him.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.920
What must be stressed over and over again

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.920
is that there is no conflict between these two forces.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.240
They stem from the same river

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.340
and flow into different areas.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.780
And this is all to the joy of mankind

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.820
because all of you, you know, you're not all the same

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.760
in the sense of the way that you have chosen to manifest.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.380
And some are very much drawn to one aspect

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.980
and certain ones to others.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.100
It would be a very limited and unfair God

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.540
who would ask that all of his creation

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.740
respond to only one kind of a vibration

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.940
because there are at least seven main ones,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.300
some of which you may be interested to know

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.140
have not yet come into the earth form.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.980
In other words, the earth does not really know

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.820
of some of them that are here at the time.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.820
So the thing that we on our side of the light

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.180
are so interested in impressing

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.820
and something that I think, sir, you have been concerned with,

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.900
is when you hear the words, "No one comes to the Father except by me,"

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.380
does this then mean that, say, the Mohammedans and so forth,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.940
are they then in some way in jeopardy of salvation?

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.900
The answer is no.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.660
But the answer is equally true, that for you, for you so much,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.100
this is a very vital truth and you should follow it.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:57.880
until the end of your day. The way to the light for you is through Christ. And you will reach

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.100
it sir, in case you have any deep questions about yourself, I would like to clear them

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:12.100
up at this time. Your past has been extremely interesting. Are you interested in this?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.660
I certainly am.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.240
Your past has been extremely interesting.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:26.600
You have had certain lifetimes of incredible impetus toward the awareness of the One.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.900
And then, in the following lifetime, it's almost as if you feel the backlash of that

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.840
tremendous push that you've made.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.080
And it's been very erratic, if you follow me.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.240
lifetime you will go so far as to have in one time been a martyred saint. I don't know

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.000
if you're aware of that, but this is a true part of your past. Were you aware of that?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.840
I hadn't been told this. Well, it's true and you should accept it as true. But then in the

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:03.680
following life, sir, it was a backlash back into, again, into a lower form of understanding.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.880
And so your incarnative patterns have been erratic.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:14.640
Now the call at this time in your life is this lifetime you are being called to cease this

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:24.840
erratic behavior and to merge every moment of your life in a very calm and deliberate

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.600
movement toward what you can achieve, which is if you wish for it this lifetime, sir,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.120
you are capable of total awareness of the One.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.840
Now I say that to very few, but I say it to you because we feel you are very much in need

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:53.960
of knowing this, that you have self-doubt in this area that has kept you from trusting

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:01.800
into your own abilities and you tend, if we may make only one small criticism of you,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.340
you tend to listen to other people too much.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.840
And this is not for you, sir.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.480
You have embodied within you, you see, you have a brilliant mind, all right?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.320
That is one gift.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.280
And we would ask that you meditate on that, because your brilliant mind has been given

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:30.980
to you for a reason. You know, it is not a matter of chance. It is a matter of design.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.920
And so we would ask you to meditate in the ensuing months on how you can best use this

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.580
incredible mind that you have. Now, that is one part of your being, and it has in the

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.640
past overshadowed to a great extent the other parts of your being, which we would like to

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:56.640
see brought into harmony with that. We're speaking particularly of the quality of heart. Your

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.640
heart, sir, is not trusting. Do you understand me when I say that?

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640
I certainly do.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:10.640
Alright. Now, you've been given a woman who loves you. Now, she is not a very clear vehicle

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.120
of this love at times because of her own fears. But it's interesting that the two of you would

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.000
have found each other because you both are of untrusting heart.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.720
And so what you are called on to do is to both of you in your own way overcome this untrusting

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.340
heart and give yourselves as totally as you can to each other in love.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:40.400
Because it is through this closeness that the two of you have that you will begin to

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:48.840
trust into that movement that is within you so strongly.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.880
I would like to touch, with your permission, on your situation of your job.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:59.280
I'm very interested in this.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.480
There is a jeopardy there for you.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.440
Now we're not speaking in terms of your life.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.380
Your life is not in jeopardy at all.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:21.120
will not be, if there is any disharmony, it will not be a part of your karmic burden.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.180
There may be such things happening when you're there, they may not be, but that is not the

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.180
point.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:34.260
The jeopardy that we speak of, it has to do with you in your development as a child of

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.540
God.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:55.660
The destiny that is held for you is far vaster than what you are allowing yourself to manifest.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:04.420
You have had in your younger years a very deep feeling of your own special destiny.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.420
Is this true?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.100
This is true.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.180
But we would venture to say that you have somehow moved away from this.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.180
Is this true?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.180
This is also true.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.180
All right.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.960
Now, we would ask you to somehow use all of the faculties of incredible mind and beautiful

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.100
heart to come together and find your place.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.020
Your place is very helpful where you are now.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:42.860
understand that if one were to talk in terms of credits in the karmic sense, do you understand

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:52.660
me? I do. You are, shall we say, accumulating a great many credits and that's all to the

00:15:52.660 --> 00:16:00.100
good because as you know all of us in this room have certain debits in that sense and

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.100
and so this is all to the good.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.100
But what we really have in mind for you

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.100
is something far different from what you're doing.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.100
It is not chance that you have married the woman that you're married to

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.100
because between the two of you,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.100
you have a very great combination of abilities

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.100
that can together help a great many people.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.100
Now, neither of you have found this to be true yet.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:33.060
yet, you haven't found your mutual niche. If I may use the example of the other two people

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:40.060
seated in the room with you tonight, they have found their karmic togetherness, you

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.340
see, and have worked in harmony as a pair and have, because of that doubling of their

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.140
abilities, brought a great many things to fruition that alone each of them could never

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:58.000
have achieved. Now the same kind of destiny is possible for you and your wife. It has

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.360
not manifested at all at this stage of your relationships. And it is, if I may be frank,

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:14.860
it is because of both of your doubting hearts. It is interesting for us on the other side

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.640
of the light to observe within each of you the tremendous love that each of you hold

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.040
each for the other, and yet to see the tremendous reluctance that each of you have for showing

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:34.760
this. Do you understand me? I certainly do. So, begin there if you would please, and have

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.120
the woman listen to this tape and maybe she'll wake up a little, because she is equally at

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:47.000
fault here. She has protected her tender heart because she has suffered, as you know, in

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.640
this time and she's tried very hard to learn from this, but part of the side effect of

00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.340
the sadness that she has suffered at the hands of the other incident is that she wants to

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:07.420
protect herself from any further pain. She knows that this is not a valid way to live

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:14.040
her life and I am very confident, very confident indeed, that she will not continue with this

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.240
much longer. She is moving into a new area of awareness and we would ask your help in

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:29.420
this. She will move into a deeper area of spiritual awareness than she ever has before and she

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:37.440
will be afraid and she will be afraid because she will be in, she feels she will be in jeopardy

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.280
of losing her deep relationship with you.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:53.080
She wants very much to serve you, but she must quit trying to serve you as a person and begin

00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:01.680
to serve you as a part of the God force, which is a very different thing.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.400
I keep asking this because I need to understand, am I making myself clear?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400
You certainly are.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400
All right.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400
Now, do you...

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:19.780
When this comes upon her, it will be extremely helpful for you to be supportive of her in

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.040
any way that you can.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:28.880
And your heart will be attuned to know what it is that she needs, and we feel sure that

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.680
you will be able to respond in kind.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:41.680
Together you must find your dual destiny because you were placed together for a very specific reason.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:52.680
And we would be very grateful for our side of things if you would find your way together to fulfill it,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:00.680
because it is important. You will both play an important part in things if you will allow yourselves to do so.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.680
You will not stay in the same type of work that you're in for very much longer,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:14.680
because as you become more and more attuned to what is going on within your deeper self,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.680
other doors will open.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.680
It is not necessary for us at this time to tell you anything,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.680
because one of the things that we want from you

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.680
is to have your own inward looking process

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.680
develop to such a high tone

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.680
that you will not need this kind of assistance.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680
Do you see?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680
I understand.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.680
And you have tremendous capabilities,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.680
tremendous capabilities along this line,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680
far more than she does.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.680
You have the intuitive quality to be able

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.680
to discern movements in the destiny.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.680
If you will reflect back on your life with her,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.680
you will realize that it is often you who says,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.680
"I feel so-and-so will happen."

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.680
And indeed, if you've kept any record at all,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.680
you'll see that this has proven to be true.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.680
Now, her talents lie in a different area.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.680
Her talents are much more in the heart quality.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.860
as you know, your mind is more brilliant than hers is, and she knows this, and she finds

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.420
no quarrel with this.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.920
We would ask that you would have no quarrel with her ability, which is a flowering of

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.680
the heart.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.360
Because you see, together you will then be able to manifest the two qualities that are

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.680
so much needed in the next years of the planet.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:52.120
Bartholomew, in the future, would it be permissible for us to check back with you to see whether

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.960
we indeed are pursuing the right path?

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:03.120
Are we in tune with the force and the plan for us?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.920
I would be pleased to do that.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:13.040
But I must also say again that the two of you joined together in power would be able to do

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.760
what is being done now with much more clarity, you see.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.920
And when I say join together, I mean actually in the beginning a literal joining together,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:32.040
say, of the hands in a mutual prayer or sitting side by side in mutual meditation.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:41.200
Now, sir, we must touch on this and we do hope that you will take it in all good humor.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.700
Are you... do you think you could do this?

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.000
I'm more than willing.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Alright.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.360
You have in the past reached deep states of awareness through meditation.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.480
And indeed, deep states through not very serious meditation.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.920
Is this true?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920
This is true.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.440
Now, the question then is, why have you given it up?

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.080
I guess I have been distrustful.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:20.880
That I think is a very true statement of the quality of the situation.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.040
Be aware that you are capable of doing and can do and must do whatever it is you wish

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040
to do.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.080
Please, there is no coercion here at all.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:44.120
we would ask on behalf of the light that we all serve that you reconsider your position.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:52.880
You have a quality that very few humans have, sir, and you are not using it.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.440
Would you care to elaborate?

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:04.920
You have an attunement with the higher forces that is almost a natural one, and you tune

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.720
into that force with relative ease so that it is hard for you to understand the struggles

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.760
that other people go through, because it is such an easy thing for you.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:25.800
But you will not be able to hear the voice that you seek to hear without some kind of

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.960
deep centering.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:36.640
And the best way of deep centering is to have a decided time for a meditative situation.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.780
It doesn't matter in your case how long it is really, because you see, you have a tremendous

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:49.200
power of concentration. It is a very compact concentration. That is part, a side effect

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.040
of a brilliant mind. A tremendous ability to concentrate, to give oneself totally. This

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.380
is something that your wife lacks, and this is her tremendous struggle. Now, this is a

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.160
tremendous ease for you, and you find no problem with it, but you don't use it. It's rather

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.180
ludicrous in a sense. She's struggling so hard for it, and you have it with such ease.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:17.700
But in a sense, she's doing better in this than you are, you know?

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.980
Because she's trying harder at this stage of her life, you see.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.900
And you have sort of given up on it, in a way.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.700
And you go to words and you go to readings, and all of this is fine.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:38.060
And we encourage, in fact, your new trend, your new movement with this new group that

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.740
were contemplating an affiliation with this church?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.740
Yes.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:52.060
This is to be encouraged in you. And all of the readings and so forth that go with it,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.220
this is to be encouraged because there's nothing there, believe me sir, there's nothing there

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.700
that you will learn that you don't know, you see, because you have all of this data recorded

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.780
within you from lifetimes. I mean, you have lived some of that data. Some of that drama

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:12.980
has been your experience, but what it will serve to do is to motivate, to reactivate

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.220
those things within you that you have allowed to go fallow.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:26.820
And you know, and this I speak to all of you in this room, when you cease to keep a body

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:33.500
form you will be accountable for what you have used, you know?

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:40.180
We've all been given, the four of you in this room have been given an incredible amount

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.980
of talent in the spiritual world.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:51.460
And when the day comes that you stand there, you will be called to reckon.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.860
You will be asked, "Have you used it?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.540
Have you really used it?"

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:10.720
So in your case, sir, you've been given a tremendous amount, and we're counting on you to use it.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.420
Other people see this in you.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:20.980
Spiritual leaders of various strains have responded to you and understood you and wanted you to

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:27.980
become a part of their process because they have understood this.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.980
But you've only gone so far and then you seem to hold back.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.980
Is this a statement that is true?

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.980
It's very true.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.980
We would ask that you reconsider this position, sir.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:45.980
You would be able to help so many more people on such a vaster system.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:54.980
You see, the things that are in line for you are much vaster than you really believe.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.820
I'm speaking of really vast work.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.500
Really vast work.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:10.140
And we've given you the woman who can help you,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.860
and we ask both of you to get on with it, if you would,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.460
because there's a lot to be done, and it's not being done.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.460
The way to begin is to begin to ask yourself deeply each day,

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.960
"What is my way? Show me the way. Teach me."

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.960
Learn, serve, to be taught, if you would.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.460
You know, you're a great teacher,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.460
but the greatest sign of a great teacher is

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.960
what kind of a student is he.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.960
And if you can become as great a student as you are a teacher,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.960
you will easily fulfill the functions that we have for you.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960
Do you have any other questions?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:00.960
Well, you know Bartholomew, you have anticipated all of the questions on my list already.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.960
I do have a small question and I think that you have in a way answered it already,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:20.760
but I wonder if you could say something about the purpose that was served in my contracting this disease, this botulism, which obviously was planned.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.800
Well first, first of all we would like to say

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:37.000
that given a very deep and difficult trial you have arisen victorious and we do salute you.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:49.880
You have gained in the last three weeks more wisdom than you have in the last three years.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:59.800
You have come again into harmony.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.120
You have left the harmony, you know, for quite a few years now.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:12.640
And in the last three weeks you have re-entered that role of one of the carriers of the light.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.640
The experiences that you have had to go through were brutal in many ways.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:28.980
But sir, it was the only thing that we could think of to do.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.840
It was to startle you.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:36.800
It was to startle the total being so that you would remember.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:47.640
It is sort of an imagery perhaps would be being thrown into an icy lake, you see?

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.480
The awakening has to be that sudden because something that all of you on the earth plane

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:03.040
tend to forget is that there are things to be done.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.820
There is much to be done and there is a lot of help needed.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.800
And often time, and please understand, it was with your full agreement that this was

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800
done.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800
Yes.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.480
It was with your full agreement that the plunge into the lake was taken.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:26.560
You see, you exist on various levels and the level on which your mind is now, for example,

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.700
all of you in this room, that is one level of existence and it is valid in its own way

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.060
with its own rules, its own rituals, its own values.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.340
But as you are all aware, there are much higher areas.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.940
Now you move, especially in the sleep state, you move to other areas.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:52.700
It is in your movement, in these other areas of time, and then out of time, that this was

00:31:52.700 --> 00:32:02.220
contracted between you and those those guides that work with you. And it was

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:08.620
discussed just as we are discussing now and the decision was made that this

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:15.700
would be undertaken. The outcome was never really crucial. There was never any

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:22.620
real question that you would die. But the question had to be raised what is life

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:28.620
for? It is only in times of extreme crisis that the questions come to the mind. What

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:39.980
is life for? What is my life for? Why am I here? And so it was agreed. And so it was.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:50.260
Now, your teacher is different from your wife's teacher. By that I mean, I am not your teacher.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.340
I love you.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.880
But your contact is different from hers.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.580
And this is good.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.160
This is very good.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:09.700
Because you see, your teacher has a whole different awareness that vibrates perfectly with your

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:15.380
awareness, just as mine vibrates perfectly with hers.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:21.020
and therefore is best able to help you.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:29.580
Your guide is so close to you that you would be astonished.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.380
And he waits and he waits and he waits.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:44.220
So we would ask you to please reconsider your life goals, please.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:54.900
If you dedicate your heart and your mind to a divine union with the power that moves through

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.740
you constantly, if you will do that, sir, we will take care of the rest of it.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.940
You know, you're a very conscientious man and much to be admired, you know?

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.140
But we'll take care of those things if you would only allow us to.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:15.140
I am speaking of mortgages, payments, education, colleges, dental bills. Do you follow me?

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.780
I do.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:24.780
We'll take care of those things for you. But we cannot begin to move as a dynamic force

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:31.780
in your life and begin these changes until you totally dedicate yourself to it. Because

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.260
Because once you do that, you will be for all intents and purposes lost to this world in

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.260
one sense.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.540
And this is why we've given you the wife that we have, because she is one of the women who

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.540
would go along with this.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.760
You know, she's not afraid of poverty.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.100
She's not afraid of not having things.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.820
She's not afraid of a lot of things.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:59.100
The one thing she's afraid of is of losing your love.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:05.020
Now, there are not many people who are like that, you know.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:14.820
There are many people who care a great deal for not having poverty, for having the finest.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:22.060
But she was carefully selected because she will be able to go along with anything that

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.100
comes along.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:34.400
So please give her the respect that is due to this, and know that she works as a part

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:42.440
of our plan with you. Use each other in the holiest sense, you see? Use each other. You

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:50.000
both have tremendous strengths. They're different, but they are not opposite. They are not in

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000
competition, they are complementary. So, would you do this? Would you give thought to this

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
at any rate? I certainly will. And see if out of this experience of a new baptism, you

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:14.120
know, the word baptism is extremely important, and especially in your life. It would be great

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:24.600
fun for you to someday be able to play back the lives of baptisms that you've

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.620
gone through, physical, the various baptisms and in various bodies of waters

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:38.980
and so forth. Is there something wrong? Can I? No, I'm just checking. And this last

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.140
experience that you've had with your illness is a new baptism. Have you

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.140
- Have you felt that at all? - Yes, I have.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.140
Fine. Because that is what we hoped. It is a total cleansing.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.140
Even to the point of your whole physical being.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:59.140
You see, it's a cleanness, it's a newness, it's a new skin.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.140
A new skin for new wine to be placed in.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.140
I think that symbology will be meaningful to you.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.140
It is meaningful.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:16.140
So, in the name of the light, and in the name of the Christ, which we both serve,

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:25.140
we would ask that you reconsider in the next few months your deepest yearnings,

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:36.140
and see if you can tune in and become one with the knowledge that your God is waiting to present to you.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.940
Have I contacted my guide before now?

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.260
Oh yes, oh yes you have.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.380
But you see, your guide stands so close to the Christ.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:38:03.020
You know, guides come in all shapes, forms, sizes, vibrations.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:19.720
yours down so close that you must, you must be in a, how can I speak this, you must be

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:28.060
in a relatively pure state to be able to, to hear him. Do you understand?

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.060
I do.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:34.060
There are many people that can meet guides, all kinds of guides,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:44.060
but the purity of the person calls forth the purity of the guide.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:54.060
And in your case, if you could work toward a greater purification,

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.060
whatever that means to you, we will not spell it out

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.260
as part of your learning process to find out what things are pure for you and what things

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:12.440
are not. But as you move toward that, it will be a dual movement. As you become more purified,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.940
you will be able then to receive so much more. You know, this is the reason for all of these

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:24.800
tremendous rituals and purification rites and in the deep Indian tradition, all of the

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:31.800
renunciations and so forth. I'm speaking now to all of you in the room. This is because

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:38.940
it is true that the degree to which the body and mind are in a pure state, they reflect

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.580
a pure light vibration. I'm sure you're all aware of this. But this is the reason for

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:50.580
it. It's nothing mysterious. The more pure your mind, the more absorbed your mind, in

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.780
In your case, sir, with the word, if you follow that meaning.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.580
I do.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.580
The more you are absorbed in the word, the purer you will become.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.280
It will be almost an automatic thing.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.380
We do not suggest that you run home and begin a great program of rigorous self-discipline.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:13.820
That would be superfluous.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:21.620
As you become one with the word, it will be almost as if the purification is done for

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.620
you.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.120
I think you have already sensed a great deal of this in the last few weeks.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120
Is that true?

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.660
It's already begun to happen.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.860
Right, and this is why we speak to it.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.580
Allow this to continue to happen, will you?

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:40.340
Don't put such restrictions on yourself that you become rigid and antagonistic, you see.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.780
Allow yourself the flow of wine, for example.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:49.480
Wine is a lovely thing. Properly used wine is a lovely thing. And your beloved Christ,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:57.320
he drank it, you know. The problem is, don't become so rigid in your disciplines that the

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:05.440
spontaneity goes out of your life. Your life will purify on its own as long as you continue

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.720
to submerge yourself in the word.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720
Yes.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.720
And so, don't worry about it.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.360
But once again, we would like to say two things to you.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:24.640
One, you have vastly underestimated your abilities

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:32.080
and your role as a child of the light in this lifetime.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:43.640
recall back to your early years and try and remember the stamp that was given so long

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:58.560
ago on your life. And we ask second that you do your utmost to use the gifts that you've

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:06.800
have been given, because very few have been called to this, sir, very few.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:17.240
You have no idea the vastness of what is asked of you, of you.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:25.280
But now through meditation and with meditating on my guide I will begin to learn more specifically

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.280
what is expected of me. Is this correct?

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.280
Once you turn your mind and heart over to Christ,

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280
your life will totally change

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.280
and you will only have to move through it.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.280
You will have to make very little effort.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.280
You see, the emphasis must be

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.280
on merging with the Word.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.280
All else will follow, all else.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.280
It will be as if out of nowhere someone approaches you

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.280
and asks if you will undertake something.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
And you will do it.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.280
I mean, you will know intuitively that it moves in harmony with the Word.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.280
If I were speaking to this person, I would say that it moves in harmony with the Tao.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.280
This is a meaningful phrase for you.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.280
This is the Word for you.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280
Do you see? I do.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:29.280
And it is such a simple thing if one turns one's entire mind and heart over to the Word,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
which you can do.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.280
And immerse yourself in that.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.280
In the first place, you will move into joy.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.280
Now joy has been a stranger to you for a long time, sir. Is that true?

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:49.280
And this does not need to be, because actually you were created as one of the joyful ones of God.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.280
And as a child, you know, you were.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:57.780
If you will think back on the early years, you were a sunny person.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.280
Yes.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.780
There was sun and joy.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.780
And then life began to take its toll and you lost this.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.780
But now is the time to move back into the sun.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.280
You know, you also carry the sign of the sun.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.780
And that's important.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.280
As in Aries, you mean?

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:23.280
Well, the sun in you, each person has a different sign.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.280
Not astrologically speaking, no. No, no.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:35.280
Astrologically speaking, quite frankly, much of the astrology is myth.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.280
Much of the astrology, now that we are on the subject,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:47.820
Much of astrology is grossly misinterpreted and twisted and I would not put a great deal

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.400
of faith in it.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:59.680
No, I'm speaking of, it's almost as if various people have stamps upon their being.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.640
And with you it's the stamp of the sun.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:11.680
And it is also the stamp of the Son of God, in a very meaningful Christian sense.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:23.000
So you will have all things open to you, but unfortunately this can only come about when

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.760
you give up all things until you are Lord.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:35.760
once you've done this, your path will be so obvious that you will shake your head in wonderment

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:42.760
that you didn't understand it sooner. You know? It will seem, "How did I miss this?"

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.760
Do you have any other questions?

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.760
Yes, I have more questions.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.760
May the woman have a drink?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:15.680
I wonder if you could speak a little bit about my wife's and my relationship with a man who

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:25.920
was our teacher or served in capacity like that for a number of years in Taos, New Mexico

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.880
and his name is Herman Rednick.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:36.720
And we have wondered for some time now whether it was right for us to leave him and what

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.800
our relationship is with him.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.800
Well, first of all, you are absolutely right to leave him.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:54.800
You see, now, for the great majority of this gentleman's following, it is right that they stay with him.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:03.800
But once again, without seeming to, what shall I say, give undue praise to you,

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:11.320
I must say again that you and your wife carry a different destiny than many people.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:18.240
And the destiny that you two will be asked to carry out is vaster than that which he

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.600
is doing.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.840
Because it will be based on a different level of vibration.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.840
He is a beautiful son of God.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.840
Beautiful son of God.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:35.520
In fact, it must be stated, and this will come as a surprise to many people, he stands closer

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.760
to the light than does your other teacher, Swami Jyoti.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:47.880
The reason being that Mr. Rednick has a great deal of humility, and it is through humility

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.720
that one comes to know God.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:57.560
And although much of what he presents can be easily and is easily garbled or has been in

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:04.560
the past, his heart is in a very pure state. Much of it is garbled, much of it is garbled,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:13.820
but the strain, the field, the force field through which he moves and which manifests

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:21.700
through him is very pure and very high strain. The problem is it gets garbled in the translation.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.260
Now this is no longer as true as it was in the past.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:37.740
And I believe that you should have no feelings of doubt or any other such feelings about leaving

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.740
him.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.140
It was part of our movement in your life to remove you.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:50.420
You know, it wasn't chance that we moved you out of that situation.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.820
If it had been best for you, you would still be there.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:54.820
You know?

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.780
It would be true.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.460
So please trust us a little more.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:07.300
Please trust that we know what is best for your destiny.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:15.380
For example, the latest meeting you've had with the leader of this church group?

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.380
Yes.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:23.380
This man will be important to you, more so to you than to your wife, but he will be important to you.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.380
That's really all we'll need to say at this time.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:34.380
But also, again, please do not be in dismay when you find yourself moving out of that situation.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.380
Ah. I see.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:47.380
Certain things are needed at certain times, and one needs to participate fully in that moment.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.380
And this is a very special and wonderful time.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:57.380
And it will come as a surprise to you, but in a few months you may be finding

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:04.380
that you and your wife are teaching him things that he needs to know, too.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:12.380
You see, it is a reciprocal agreement you've made to come to greater understandings.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380
Do you see?

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.380
Yeah.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.380
There's something on both sides.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.380
There are certain things that he needs to know that you know.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:24.380
And there are certain things that you need to know that he knows.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.380
So there will be an exchange.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:33.380
But please don't be overly concerned when it comes to it.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.380
May I ask another question?

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.380
Certainly.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.380
Of perhaps a more theoretical nature,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:48.380
I have observed through the various experiences that have occurred to me,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:53.380
and this recent one with Bajelzman being an example,

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:58.380
that the major events of my life,

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.380
the major things that have happened to me, for example,

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:09.380
my marriage with Mary Margaret, the several occupations I've had, my interest in philosophy

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:16.380
and what not, the child that was born to us, the other children. These things do not seem

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:23.820
to be my doing and they don't seem to be matters in which I've ultimately had very much say

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:30.220
in, although on a more mundane level I can see that I made certain choices and there

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.180
were certain results, I really have the impression that I don't have much control over what happens

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.180
to me.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.940
Well, of course you don't.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:47.420
And just be grateful that you don't.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:53.020
Left to our own devices on the earth plane, as I remember so well from my experience when

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:59.340
I was there, left to our own devices on the earth plane, things would be chaotic indeed

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:05.340
if we were allowed to manifest all of our various and sundry desires,

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.340
can you imagine a universe founded on that basis?

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.340
Pandemonium.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.340
You would not wish, you would not wish to live there.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.340
You would not.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:22.340
Now, I would like to say one thing, however, that might not be clear to you.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:27.340
One moment, please.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.340
I would like to try to get in touch with your guide.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.340
Oh, excellent.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:38.340
I'm not sure the vehicle of the woman can do it. We will have to try.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:53.340
Justin.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.340
Yes, Master.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:08.980
It has been a long time.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.300
Indeed.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:17.220
Have you not missed me?

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.900
I have longed for you greatly.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:25.220
Then why have you not come?

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:33.540
my own doubts and fears that have prevented this.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.460
Listen.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.740
Listen well.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.540
It is my service to you

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:53.260
that those who come to me will be relieved of doubts and fears.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:54:05.260
There is nothing upon the earth plane that will be able to ever remove your doubts and your fears.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:19.260
If you wish peace, joy, light and wisdom, there is but one place that you can come for it.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:24.860
I have taught you this in past times.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:28.180
I come to remind you again.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.180
I am waiting.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:39.460
Master, can you give me specific instructions as to what you would want me to do at this

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.460
time in my life?

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:51.100
You have abandoned our connection.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:57.400
You have ceased to strengthen it.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:06.620
If you cease to strengthen it, it is as if it does not exist.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:18.940
You will build a connection again through two ways.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:31.960
You must begin an organized, deliberate time of meeting with me.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.760
I will be there.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.880
Will you be there?

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.880
I will be there.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.880
Second,

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:49.880
you must learn to listen to yourself.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:57.880
It was said earlier this evening, I will say again.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:06.880
You listen to others too readily.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:13.880
Your way is your way.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:23.880
Created between us before Earth life began.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.880
There is much to be done

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.180
and I'm waiting

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:40.520
Please

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:45.640
Don't keep me waiting much longer

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:53.900
Master is there any particular meditation that you wish me to use?

00:56:53.900 --> 00:57:11.900
You have, through your lifetimes, many, many lifetimes, thrown yourself at the foot of

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:25.980
cross, embrace the cross, receive strength and renewal from the cross. Is this true?

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:39.940
This is true. Then I suggest that you continue this. Yes, Master. It is through your

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:50.300
Your surrender to the cross as you perceive it, that you will be renewed.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:58.260
In time of doubt, throw yourself at the foot of the cross.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:08.100
It has not failed you, and it will not fail you.

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:21.220
Christ is your way and I stand as his hand for you.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:32.900
Please recall the plans that we made before time.

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:42.900
Please respond to what you know to be your destiny.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.900
Go to the cross and it will always answer you.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:51.900
Are there any other questions, Naroons?

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.900
Perhaps we'd better hold off until tomorrow.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:59.900
I think the vehicle has been tired.

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:08.900
The last was harder on her. Yes. So, sir, have we finished? We have. Thank you Bartholomew.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:16.900
And we thank you for bringing the other master to us this evening.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:24.900
And now, returning the vehicle to normal consciousness,

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:31.900
with a feeling of accomplishment, a feeling of peace and serenity,

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:40.900
a gratefulness for the privilege of being such a useful vehicle for these forces

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:45.900
that are leading all of us.

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.900
And we'll count from five to one.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:54.900
On the count of one, you will be back to normal consciousness,

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.900
feeling wonderful.

00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:04.900
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:12.900
Good afternoon.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.900
Good afternoon, Marcella.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.900
Have you questions, then?

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.900
Yes.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:30.900
First, I would like to ask for some insight from your perspective on our relationship with our friend Alice.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:42.900
Well, this is a difficult relationship in the terminology of the world that has come home to roost, I believe is the term used here.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:49.900
Make no mistake, this is an old, old relationship. More in relationship to your wife really than

01:00:49.900 --> 01:01:02.300
to yourself, but nevertheless in periphery part for you. I believe I will address most

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.900
of this to your wife since she does seem to be the focal point of this.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.900
Do you want to sit over here?

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.900
If you don't mind, it's easy for me.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:23.900
The first thing that we would really like to tell you is that

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:29.900
although the circumstances may be extremely difficult for you on the physical plane,

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.900
there is a debt here of tremendous importance.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:42.900
Your connection with her is old, has not been very important in this lifetime at all,

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.900
but nevertheless carries a very strong impression from two lifetimes ago.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:54.900
This is a carryover, of course, that is created out of your consciousness and also out of hers.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:03.700
The reason that she is here in this particular relationship is to enable you to repay this

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:12.700
small debt that has been left over.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:18.600
The main thing is to remember that it will not be of a very long-lasting nature.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:25.900
She will not be in relationship to you in this way for very much longer, but make good use

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:32.080
of it if you would while she's here because there are some important lessons.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.400
First of all, the most important thing that we would ask you to remember is that there

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.160
is nothing you can do for her.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:49.680
Well, this is because of your awareness of freedom that can exist on the earth plane

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.860
within one's mind if one's mind has light in it.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:57.720
You feel that you would like to in some way transfer this wisdom to her so that you may

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.000
help her.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.340
One hates to give up on anyone, but please rest assured that experts have tried in this

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.180
field and have failed.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:14.400
She has been given many, many opportunities to lighten her load, literally to lighten

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.700
it, to bring light to herself, to her load.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:24.140
She has within her conscious memory in this lifetime many, many references of various

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:31.980
religions and text work that would, if she would become deeply concentrated on it, would

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.420
tremendously lighten her life.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:38.260
But each time she has chosen to remain as she is.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:43.660
So please, first and foremost, do not feel at all responsible for transforming any of

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.660
this.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:52.300
And don't even make a terribly great effort to incorporate her into your group or to make

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:56.140
any special efforts along that line.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:03.180
In a sense, we are dealing with a spoiled child who has for many years been allowed to be spoiled

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.180
and continues it in this later advanced years.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:11.180
But don't be overly concerned.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.180
And when you're there, our concern mostly

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.180
is that she will try to somehow bleed from you.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:23.180
This is a term that we use.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:27.180
I don't know how it translates through for you.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.180
A bleeding of an energy field from one person to another is a very common

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.180
thing on the earth plane that is not always observed by the humans.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:40.180
You mean, excuse me, that she would drain energy from me?

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:51.180
She, yes. Now this takes many forms. It's not just a matter of as you sit there that she will somehow remove it from you.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.180
It usually will come in the terms of wanting you to do extra extraneous things for her.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:03.180
her, in other words you using your energy for her rather than first her doing it herself.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:10.020
Now there are things that other people performed for this woman she could do for herself and

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:17.020
it is a way of her becoming center stage you see and that's all a very childish response

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:23.340
to this situation and really if you can get it out of your mind that you're dealing with

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:29.140
an adult I think you will do better. Just look on her with a tender hearted concern as you

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:34.680
would of a child who has not yet reached the state of maturity. The sad thing of course

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.280
is that she will cross over and will still be in this state and then we'll have much

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:47.900
to do but that is really not your concern. So our worry is do not allow her to misuse

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:57.620
your energy and your time, because it is not as if you were helping her to be more positive.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:05.820
Do what you feel is vital and is loving and is necessary, but please be well aware that

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:13.500
there is a childish resentment in her against any field of love for anyone else that you

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:20.500
may have. And this includes your husband. She resents the time and the ties that you have

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.180
built up with him. She will resent very much knowing, for example, when your family is

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:31.060
here, this will be another time that she will have difficulties. These patterns will, you

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:36.540
know, repeat themselves with anyone who is close to you. But just as you would not indulge

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:43.460
a child, as you would just be firm and loving, we would request that you consider this approach.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:50.460
to her. One, you cannot really help her, so please don't make overly conscientious efforts

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:58.260
along that line. And two, really stand removed. There is on the earth plane at this time a

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:06.580
lot of children, a lot of children who are called, I cannot remember the term, I'm sorry,

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:13.580
who are called... I cannot remember the term. I'm sorry.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:20.580
The way it is seen for us is they are overly active, much too tension ridden.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.580
Hyperactive, do you mean?

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:28.580
Yes. Now, there are many more of them on the earth plane at this time than there ever have been.

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.580
And this is an interesting question that no one seems to have asked yet as to why.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.580
Well, this woman should be considered as one of these.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.580
She will make excessive demands, she will be very arbitrary,

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.580
she will be very full of temper and tantrums in a sense.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:49.580
And just treat it as you would one of these children.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.580
Have you anything else you'd like to add?

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.580
Well, yes, just one more question.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.580
You mentioned that I had a debt that I owe to her.

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:05.580
anything else, what type of a debt, or what I, anything else which I need to do for her

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:12.700
even though I can't help her with her understanding, is there any other debt here that I need to?

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.740
Well it is a small matter in terms of, in the two lifetimes ago that I spoke of, there was

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:22.740
an opportunity when you were less developed two lifetimes ago, you become a great deal

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:30.940
in your two lifetimes. And two lifetimes ago, there was an opportunity for you to help her

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.060
in a physical manner, on the physical plane, simply in a physical way, and you turned on

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:42.940
it and didn't. And it's simply that. It's nothing terribly complicated or terribly...

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:48.540
It's certainly nothing other than that. It's simply you have the opportunity, you have

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:54.940
chosen to play it out at this time and to end your responsibility and to, as it were, clean

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.940
up the slate.

01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940
And that's all it is.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:01.740
Well, I guess what I'm asking then is just the fact that I bring her in and out and check

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.580
and make sure that she's all right and that she has food or that she has her needs taken

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:07.580
care of.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.580
That takes care of it.

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:09.580
That does take care of it.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.580
Thank you so much.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:16.780
There's no need and you must please stay free from any concern.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:24.380
The moment she really wants help, there is so much crowding within her home that is waiting

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.300
to assist her.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:38.460
So we simply wait for her choice.

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.860
We have been considering starting what we might call a core group from some of those

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.860
who have been with us in our quest group for a period of time,

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:56.860
going into some of the deeper truths that are less possible in a fluctuating group as a quest group.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:02.860
And I would like to suggest that you might have for the functioning of this group

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:08.860
and perhaps individuals that might benefit the most from it.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:17.740
Well, I think it's a wonderful idea and I'm so glad you picked it up because it is something

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:24.700
that we have been suggesting in various ways to you for quite a while and we're very pleased

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:31.940
that you have received this message because this is indeed what is needed because your

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:36.700
group does function on two levels and there are those who are very much ready for a deeper

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.700
group.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.700
there is one problem you will have to face.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.700
The ones who do not...

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:49.700
The problem that you will face is how to get the core group to function

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:55.700
without making the others feel in any way left out.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:05.700
Now, I think that one of the ways to avoid this obvious problem

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:12.700
is if you announce that you are going to start a very serious study group

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:18.700
and that it will involve a degree of commitment

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.700
that certain ones of them will eliminate themselves automatically

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.700
Do you understand what I mean?

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.700
Some of them will say, well obviously I don't have the time, I don't have the interest and so forth

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.700
They will be eliminated

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:37.240
But then there will be others who will be drawn, who will not really be as committed as they

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.640
think they are, but for a social reason or for their own ego or for whatever reason will

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.800
then be drawn to come in.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.560
I would not be overly concerned about them, because one of two things will happen.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.760
They will either become very serious, which is of course what you would hope for, that

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.340
through the deeper studying that they are into, this will then bring forward the very

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:05.380
thing that you're trying for or they will find of themselves that they are either bored or

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:10.040
can't find the time or will weed themselves out of your situation.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.060
Don't be overly concerned but I think your presentation must be very strong that this

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:24.980
is a disciplined or you see there will be a set text even so much as a beginning text.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.680
You see what I'm saying? It must be structured in a very disciplined manner.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.880
There should be required times of meditation for them,

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.880
whatever you choose to set up.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.380
But there must be a commitment on their part prior to joining it.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:48.380
If you could present it as sort of an experiment, if you will.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:52.380
You know, that you would like to experiment on whether certain things are beneficial or not,

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:56.540
and you would like a certain core group to work with you.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.140
Now if everyone in your group volunteers, then you will have a difficult problem

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.880
and you may have to drop the project. Do you see?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.220
Yes.

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.500
If the night that you announce it, they all say,

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.120
"Fine, let us turn this night into that serious study,"

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.260
then you will have to think about that.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.660
Then you may have to impose those rules right then

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.780
and say that this is a requirement

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:26.780
And that henceforth, anyone who comes on that particular night will have to fulfill these requirements. Do you see?

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.780
Well, we're making it an afternoon meeting for that reason, I think.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:44.780
Well, my point is this. If on your night of your meeting you announce this, everyone will say, "Well, that's why we're here. That's why we're sitting here. That's just what we want."

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:57.280
Now this will then give you pause and you may then have to say, "All right, then let us turn this into a definite group meeting with definite structures."

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:05.280
You see, the rules that would have applied to your afternoon meeting will now have to be applied to your evening meeting and then you'll have to see how it works out.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:13.280
You see, embryo things like this move in different directions and often surprise you.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.960
You may get a lot of the people that come in the evening will simply not come anymore

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.960
because it's too intense, they don't get to talk enough, they have to do too much meditation,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.900
things are too deep, you see, they will weep themselves out.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.280
So one of two things can happen.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:37.620
I think you would do best if you would keep an open mind and as you present it to say

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:46.720
we would like to have a very serious core group that will go into deeper areas of these subject

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.420
fields and I would appreciate it if those of you who are interested will contact me

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:59.600
at a later time, alright, because this then removes that spontaneous combustion of everyone

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.600
saying, "Oh, now, now, I want to, do you see, to say, please contact me at a later time."

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:10.360
That in itself will weed out a lot of the people who will not take the time to telephone, to

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.120
set up an appointment to come and see you.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.120
And I think that you should both be very serious about that first meeting when they come, each

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.720
one comes on their own to you, to really work with them as to whether it is something they

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.720
really want.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.720
In other words, to have a certain standard that you will set

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.720
and then ask them if this is really what they're looking for.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:38.720
Sort of like you have an opening in a job, you know.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:46.720
You have to present your desires and what you want in the group

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.720
and then see if that person who is sitting there will be able to fulfill that

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.720
or who even wants to.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.720
You must be sober about it, is my meaning.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.200
is my meaning. Otherwise, you are going to have the same pattern repeating. Only your

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.640
afternoon group will be filled with people who don't work and who don't want to go to

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:13.000
the supermarket, you see. So, much of it depends on your seriousness and please, as much as

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.120
you can, put aside all preconceived ideas of who should belong, because you may be surprised.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120
May I ask a question?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.120
Sure.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:29.920
Do I understand you correctly that when we announce this meeting and then when we set

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:40.920
a time that they come, we should have a program laid out, say, if we would work it out between

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.440
ourselves that we are going to study such and such a book or we are going to spend this

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.560
much time in meditation and that kind of thing, to have a program laid out that we present

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.560
to them?

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560
What you mean?

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.280
My thought was this.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.600
The evening comes and you announce that you are going to, do not say you are thinking

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.960
of, just that you are going to start a core group.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:14.080
And anyone who is interested, please contact you by phone at a later date and you will

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:21.560
set up with each person individually a time when they come to your home and discuss with

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.040
you whether they would really want to participate in this.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Do you see?

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.640
And then each one will come at a separate time.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.000
Not having four people come at once.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.680
Because you see what you really want is first of all the person who cares enough to make

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.240
the phone call, the person who cares enough to set up the interview, the person who cares

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.040
enough to give thought to what you present.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.520
Now when each one of them individually comes and speaks to you, that is when you should

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.920
say this is a rigorous program, this is what we have in mind, we are going to have these

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.000
as our certain criteria and we really want this to be a much more intense and serious

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.380
situation.

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:04.800
Now many of the egos will respond yes, yes, but in actuality many of them will probably

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:12.040
drop out because they will not be able to fool themselves about how rigorous they are

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:22.980
being and I think it would be important, very important that there be a knowledge in them

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:28.880
that if they do take this on that they will really give themselves to it for a certain

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.120
period of time as an experimental group.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.480
But again I say you should be serious about this and the reason I say that is that you

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:43.480
tend to be a little tenuous about things like this, you see, you are a little tenuous.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.480
And that is not really... that would make them tenuous.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.480
Well, if I do the work, that's all right, but if I don't, well, then that's all right.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.480
This kind of thing.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.480
So if you could be a little more sober about that.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.480
Yes. Thank you.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.480
Well, the next point that I wanted to ask about...

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:12.480
Arnold Toynbee, the historian, made a statement recently that, as he saw,

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.480
one of the most important events in this era was the interpenetration of Christianity by Buddhism.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.480
Do you have any comments on that?

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:34.480
The movement of the world, the movement of all of the forces on the earth plane, is toward a oneness.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:43.480
The statement that he is making comes from his bias and should be understood as such.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:52.480
But what is represented in the truth of all that kinds of statements is that the aim of those of us

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.120
that stand on the other side of the light is to pierce the mind of man with the knowledge

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:05.120
that the energy from which each varying religion derives its meaning comes from one source,

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:12.680
and any inner penetration is only successful to the extent that each of those two entities

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.040
come to see their deep similarity at source.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:22.200
It would be a same truth in a statement to say that Mohammedanism and Christianity coming

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:28.440
together would be an important event, or the religion of Islam, whatever, because what

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:36.160
is really the thrust of our work is for all to see that there is one source, there is

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:43.480
one source, and any movement that can be made on the earth plane for peoples to blend their

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:49.880
varying dichotomies together into an awareness that there is only one source from which they

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:59.380
spring, that is a very monumental movement on the part of the human entity.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:06.680
So there's not anything particularly special about Buddhism and Christianity meeting.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:12.620
The only time that it will be at all special is if, as a result, if these two different

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:18.540
feelings, these two different strains can blend together to the point where they

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:25.700
recognize their one desire, their one basic source from which they spring, then

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:30.100
it will have been a successful experiment. It is by no means a completed fact.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:36.140
By no means. And in fact there is jeopardy because it could set them up,

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:41.220
set many people up in opposition. You see, any kind of a force like this also

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:46.260
creates an opposite force and some of that opposite force is taking a great

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:52.780
deal of manifestation in in the Christian world where they are becoming, if I may

01:21:52.780 --> 01:22:00.660
say, bullheaded about this, you see. They are... it's almost a backlash of

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:06.460
isolation. The Christian movement is becoming perhaps even more isolated in a

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:12.940
sense, a certain strain of it, as a result of what they consider to be the threat of

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:17.100
this Buddhist philosophy.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:22.460
The basic important thing for all concerned from our perception, the basic thing that

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:28.780
they need to see is to drop all of the extraneous things that are not the same.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.260
For example, the enlightened Buddhist or the enlightened Christian would tell you that

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.620
the understanding of Christ and the Buddha are very similar.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.620
They are very similar.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.860
There are certain areas in course where they differ because of many obvious things.

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:48.980
But the truth, the heart of both of these, be with truth.

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.940
And this is what is hoped.

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.700
This is what is hoped, you see.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:56.340
Now, it may not be successful.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.020
It may not work.

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:05.200
You implied one time that that was part of my function at this time, was to promote this

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200
sort of thing.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200
Yes, this is still true.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.680
And the reason that you are helpful in this regard is that you are able to also see the

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.140
truth that lies in Christianity.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:19.880
You see, it is not very helpful to have a lot of people biased.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.660
A lot of Christians saying that their way is the only way, and a lot of Buddhists, which

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.660
which they also say that their way is the only way,

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:33.660
we observe a very interesting thing.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:39.660
The Hindu, for example, says that he is willing to honour other gods and so forth.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:45.660
But in fact, if you wish to take each individual Hindu, you see,

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:49.660
and ask that particular Hindu his particular deep belief,

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.900
will tell you is that his particular deity is the strongest.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.900
Do you see?

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.860
There really is very little...

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:03.020
A Buddhist for example is very willing to say yes, that Christianity can be accepted and

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:08.340
so forth, but if you take a particular Buddhist and speak to him clearly, what he says is

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.100
Buddha is the way.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.860
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:21.980
So the theology of these various religions gives approval of other religions in the heart

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:27.960
of the person who is doing the worshipping, there is the feeling of superiority over other

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.940
religions.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:36.940
And this is what we want so much, to see breaking down if we can.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.740
And the reason that you will be helpful, you will be helpful to the extent that you can

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:47.700
see the Christ heart beating within the Buddhist heart and realizing that they both beat with

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.860
the same pulse because it is the pulse of God.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:58.180
You see, they tend to forget that it is God that is the source from which all of these,

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:07.260
the Christ and the Buddha spring, you see, and the emphasis must go back to the source

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:11.260
And to the similarities instead of to the dissimilarities.

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.260
Yes.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:20.260
There was... once you made a statement about reincarnation

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:26.260
and it seemed to me that you viewed the subject from a different perspective

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:30.260
from the usual one that we have here on this planet.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:36.260
Would you help us with your insight on this process?

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:45.260
Well, incarnation, reincarnation, the whole subject is very muddled.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:57.260
The reason for this is, of course, the ego's tremendous desire to feel that it will live on forever.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:05.260
And therefore it tries very hard to keep its life pulse beating throughout eternity.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:11.660
Therefore, you have many of the doctrines that say that one life follows another and

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.420
so forth.

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:26.220
What I am going to say will probably not please many of you, or maybe any of you, but what

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:36.860
is true is that your life, as each one of you individually live it, is not as separate from

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:45.820
other people's lives as your perception would lend you to think. For example, in the case

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:55.100
of you and your wife, you've spent many years together. You might perceive your life as

01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:02.940
your own entity moving through certain steps, affected by your past actions.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.620
This is a typical view of reincarnation.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:11.940
Now that is partially true, but it is partially not true, because the fact is that if you

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:18.140
could perceive with the inner eye rather than just the eyes of the body, you would perceive

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.180
that the body of you and your wife, there is no difference.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:30.140
If you could see this room now, and could see the perception of the movements, the undulating

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:35.220
movements of life that move between these four bodies, you would laugh at this idea

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.740
of your tremendous separateness, because you are not separate.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:44.500
You see, a thought comes from that gentleman there, over this way, and its movement blends

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.660
with what is happening here and changes it.

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.460
There is not this tremendous wall that separates each one.

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:58.100
And this is why the great teachers have emphasized over and over and over again, when you begin

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:04.620
the movement toward awareness of the light, of the God-Self, of the Christ, of the Buddha,

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:10.060
whatever, when you begin this movement, the reason they asked you to be selective about

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:15.340
who you're with is because of this very phenomenon of which I'm speaking.

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:20.640
It is not some kind of a prudish, specialistic idea.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.040
It is simply a truth that you blend.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.180
And the ones that are closest to you in physical form are the ones you blend the easiest with.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.740
This makes good sense to you, I hope.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:36.840
So therefore, this is why we have a concern about this gentleman and his job, that he

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840
is chosen.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.700
Do you hear me, sir?

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.140
I certainly do.

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:45.820
Because he also is not separate from all of the movements that are happening out where

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.060
he is located.

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:54.980
And although we have done our best to protect him with a shield of light, there is only so

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:59.060
much that one can do when a person is placed in that environment.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:05.420
The reason that he will move out of his location is simply that as he becomes more purified,

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:11.960
his consciousness becomes more and more attuned, it will be increasingly, instead of being

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:17.500
easier to be there, it will be more difficult to be there, because there will be this continual

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500
mingling.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.380
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:28.660
That their consciousness of those entities is on a lower plane at this time and is unfortunately

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:35.940
kept isolated because that's almost all they have and they draw onto them people who they

01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.740
call guards whose consciousness are very similar.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:46.420
Now the exceptions are in the teaching staff and various other pinpoints of light that

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.820
I perceive now in that building.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.220
There are some pinpoints of light.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.380
The teaching end of the building has this.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:58.860
But if you understand me, sir, this is one of the reasons why you may find yourself moving

01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.860
out of that.

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860
I understand.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860
All right.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.860
Now, back to the reincarnation.

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:10.620
It is very, very funny for us to view all of you feeling that your little life is so

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:17.740
special and so separate and so very independent from our perception.

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:23.620
Please be glad that this is not so, because if this were true, it would be extremely difficult

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:30.420
for you to transcend, extremely, because you see, if you were independent one from another,

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:35.500
you would also be independent from the source of the good ones, from the source of the great

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:43.940
ones that stand there, you see. You cannot be isolated only from other people and also

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:50.460
then be open to the vast wisdom of the great ones that stand there, you see. So be grateful,

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:56.420
pleased that it's been set up in this manner, it is much more wonderful if you can get your

01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:02.140
minds just to turn a slight degree, so much more wonderful to realize that as the four

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:09.380
of these bodies sit in this room, that what they all are is just melding and merging and

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:15.780
doing in many ways a lovely rhythm, you see. And this is why the environment in which you

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:19.780
speaks importantly to you also.

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:22.780
You know, if you live in a very dark hovel,

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.780
there is something within that dark hovel

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.780
that can press upon you and you will become a part of that

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:32.780
because you see, you are a part of this.

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:33.780
You are a part of this.

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.780
You know there is nothing in this environment

01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.780
that you are not in movement with.

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.780
From your perception, it's a lot of separate things.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:44.780
In reality, it is movement.

01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:53.980
And so again, sir, to you I would say that the environment that you are in presents this jeopardy

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.680
because they are confined into one limited area.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:04.180
This makes the power of it stronger and there's less likelihood of it opening up.

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.180
Now the one fortunate thing is where it is placed.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.780
I see it on a vast mesa.

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:13.280
Open, pretty open area, is that true?

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.180
Absolutely.

01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:21.180
and this is very helpful because you see there is a movement, a harmony of land and sky and

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:29.020
cloud, wind moves through there and that does help to dissipate a lot of that and it is a

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:35.520
fortunate choice to place these institutions out in such areas and not say in the heart

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:43.300
of the city where they would be even more impacted with difficult mindsets because the land itself

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.380
vibrates to help them, you see.

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.620
There is a movement within the land because

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.080
there is no separation between the sand

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.720
and the sky and the sea

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:54.840
and the building and the beings, you see.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.980
There is this movement, this constant exchange.

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.060
Have I made this clear for you?

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:07.640
This matter you said that

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.760
talked about successive lives, like in my wife's two lives, two lifetimes ago.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.760
How does that relate to what you've been saying?

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:26.760
There is always a focal point in a sense that we would call in this case Louisa Aiken.

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:35.760
Alright, now Louisa Aiken perceives herself as the same person with various changes moving through one lifetime.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:47.760
Now in reality, if she could see herself, she would realize that she is now a tremendous composite of a great many other people's images, movements, thought forms and so forth.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.760
But there still is a center core around which some of these adhere.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:34:03.760
Now the most important particles, the most important movements coalesce into the strongest particles.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.400
Now I'm not speaking necessarily of the most positive or the most negative, I'm just saying

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:17.640
the strongest, it's as if there's a magnet named Louisa and certain forces are drawn

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:24.400
to her and some pass right through her because there is no responding magnetism of any kind

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.200
and they just become unimportant, they do not affect the core of the person.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.120
And on the other hand, certain other things move through her that have a tremendous correlation

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.600
that have what you would call a hook-up.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:47.080
It's almost a molecular, it is a light hook-up within her of correspondence, of vibration,

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.680
and they stay with her.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.880
And so it is this essence that we speak of as Louisa.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.640
Now to go, to say two lifetimes ago is very helpful for her at this moment in understanding

01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.740
her situation with this woman. Alright? Now if I were to speak from another perception,

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:09.740
I would say there is a residue within this woman, within Louisa, that needs to be dissipated.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:18.100
It will be dissipated through the giving of light to this manifestation outside herself

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:24.980
that she sees as this other woman. In this giving to her, the thing will be, the molecular

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:31.700
attention will be broken and this will drift away from her and no longer be a part of her.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.700
Do you understand me?

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.700
I think so.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700
Would you like a clarification?

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700
Well, I was thinking, I think it's the same thing, different people that we meet that

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:51.020
come through our lives and I have noticed this in myself, that some of them you just

01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:54.900
automatically feel a great closeness and a love

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.580
and an enjoyment of being close to them and being with them.

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:02.580
There are other people, very nice people, very good people

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.980
that you don't feel that same attraction for.

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.340
And I have wondered about that. Is that what you're saying?

01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:10.900
That they're on a different vibration?

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:17.220
That's true. They're not important for what you are a composite of at that moment.

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:22.220
For example, someone who in your terminology is not very spiritually evolved,

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.920
this is the term that you use,

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.020
what you really are saying is that the vibrational impact of that person

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:35.920
is pulling toward it like impact and it is on the same frequency level.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.520
Now as that person allows themselves,

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.220
and this usually often has to happen in times of crises,

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.120
in times of crises we act in different ways.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.880
we have the power at certain junctures of life

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.560
when a call is made, this is why crises are so important,

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:59.560
a crisis comes into the life of say this so-called lower evolved person,

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:07.320
the crisis breaks them into, jolts them into an asking.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:13.320
Now they've asked, this is our chance, you see, because prior to that we cannot

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:19.880
in, you see, we cannot just keep hounding that person and hounding that person. Their free

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:25.360
will is what motivates what will happen to them. The crisis comes, the crack in the armor,

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.320
they call out in whatever way, "Oh my God, help me. If you will help me, I give you promises

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.920
to do this, this, this," so forth, you see. Many times we see this happen. Many times

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:40.560
they renege on them in later times, you see. All these promises are just forgotten. That

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:47.360
That is not the point. The point is that at that moment there is a crack. The vibrational

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:53.520
entity has said, "Help." The minute this cry comes, we then begin our movement. And we

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.120
move with them as long as they ask. And we would move with that entity until the day

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.660
the entity chose to move to the light. If they would hold that, you see, if they would

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:12.200
hold that call, but they don't. The crisis is resolved, they go back to their normal way

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:18.060
of existence, they're very grateful that they're still, you know, alright and whatever, or if

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:23.060
their son has been saved or, you know, many times we see this kind of thing. The promises

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:30.060
are forgotten, or if they're done, they're done as just a debt to be paid. But, but, with

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:36.940
that call something has happened, you see. Now, with that little wedge, they are then

01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:46.300
able to have another light harmony move for them, you see. It's as if there's a crack

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:52.620
in the sphere and the light rushes into that sphere and it remains there. And it draws

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:59.380
to it, its own likeness now, which is light, you see. And eventually, as the years go on,

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:04.060
as lives go on, more crises happen as is the designated plan.

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:10.820
One of the main reasons for crises is to continually crack this sphere open more and more and more

01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:14.860
and more until it is nothing but a ball of gold and white.

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.820
That is what we're really aiming for.

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:22.860
As each one of these crises enters in, it cracks it open more and more and each time

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:28.980
you see, more rushes in, you see, and that gives them a greater chance the next time

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:34.120
to call its like form because like calls like, you see. And much of the sphere may still

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:40.360
have, pressing on it, the negative similarities, but then we mustn't forget that that is also

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:47.360
here, this light. And what happens so often, you see a young child with a great many problems

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.640
and you think, "Poor thing, poor thing." From our perception, this is not true, you

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.480
see. It is often the opposite. Some of the strongest entities in the life cycle are those

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.040
whose childhoods were extremely difficult.

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.120
Because it's at these junctures that they intuitively call out

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.600
and bring into them, through their call, more of the light.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.960
Do you see what I mean?

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.840
The child that has a perfect upbringing and has a lot of joy and a lot of love,

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.040
often time will find in its twenties, thirties, forties and so forth,

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.360
then they begin to have the cracks in the sphere.

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.480
Now this is something that's set up ahead of time

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:34.400
and doesn't need to concern us. It's set up in certain ways because of certain desires.

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:40.800
Some of the hardest incarnations are taken on because of the entity's deep desire to

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:47.500
get on with it, you know, to just drop much of this in one lifetime. And although things

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:54.120
on the outside look tremendously difficult, actually they've been wise in many ways. But

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.220
I still sense your question.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:02.440
There was no Louisa Aiken two lifetimes ago.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.560
There wasn't even someone who now we now call Louisa Aiken.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.160
I mean the changes that have gone, that she has gone through, not only as an incarnate

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:16.280
being but in the freedom of the other planes in between her incarnations, there is no likeness

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.280
at all.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.800
There is residue.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.040
And this is what we speak to in this particular point.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040
There is a residue.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.040
What the Buddhists call the skandhas I think it's called?

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040
Yes, yes.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040
The bundle of whatever it was.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.040
Yes, that is the kind of meaning that I'm seeking to convey.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.040
Like the flame in the candle.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.040
Right, now had this woman...

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:46.040
It doesn't have to be this particular woman from two lifetimes ago.

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.040
Had you been aware earlier in this lifetime,

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.840
time there were other instances, other connections with other people that could have removed

01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:00.000
this from you. But the fact was that you at those particular junctures of your life you

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.120
were working on other things. You see there's only so many things that you can deal with

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.360
at once. And so we're always learning. And we move from one awareness to another you

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.320
see. And now here is this one coming at a very right time, right for you and right for

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.880
her, the circumstances are set, you have the time, you're not working on anything else

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.720
at the moment, this gives you the breathing space to work with it and deal with it and

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:33.720
remove it from your life. Do you see it? Did I answer your question?

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:40.720
I think so, yes.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:50.720
Do I understand that you have been my teacher or do I have another teacher that is my own teacher?

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.720
I am not your primary teacher.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:43:00.720
Yes. Would direct contact such as you had last night with your husband be of any help to me?

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.720
I think we should postpone that.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.720
Okay.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:16.000
The type of connection that we seek to make, and we can make that, is best done in the

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.800
hours of the night when the world, the place in the world where you exist is in a quieter

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:23.800
state.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:30.960
It will be easier on the woman at that time.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:36.920
the channels would be much easier for her in the evening.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:44.600
She has a certain intuitive movement with her child, and in the evening when the child is

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:51.060
in bed and taken care of and she can remove this situation from her mind, she is much

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.800
freer to do this.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.760
And we have to be careful of her too, because she, you know, she's a part of this whole

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:05.760
process and we are trying to be as understanding about her needs as possible.

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:11.080
But by all means, and please ask it again in an evening situation, and I feel quite sure

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.200
at this time that something of that nature can be done.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.200
Yes, thank you.

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.120
Our friend Jim Koch has been...

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.840
May the woman have some water, too.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.280
...has been a seeker for a long time.

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.280
No, that is not true.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.280
He thinks he has very much sight.

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:31.280
he thinks he has very much say, and he wonders whether there would be any advice you could give him.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:46.280
None of this that I say now should be repeated.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.280
Okay.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.280
Because he would not be able to hear it.

01:44:51.280 --> 01:45:08.160
But the image of this gentleman is one of many, many layers of desires.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:17.560
It's almost as if there is layers and layers of serpents of desires winding around the

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.160
pole of his center being.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.720
Is the image clear to you?

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:29.920
And there are many, many of them around this center core.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:45.120
And he is drawn to the quest because of the core of the being, which is of course the

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.680
same core as with the rest of mankind.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:58.520
But in this particular case, he would do much better to spend his time forgetting, almost

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:06.160
putting aside the question of the spiritual quest, and concentrating on the human quest.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:12.560
That he is not even a successful person in a functioning sense in the human material

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.480
world.

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.060
And there is no grounding.

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:23.220
he is not grounded in the sense that he is always in a state of flux.

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:29.840
I see this image as given of movement, constant movement, not movement upward or movement

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.740
downward but just kind of a dissipated movement in all directions, which is interpreted to

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:41.220
mean that his energies are simply going off in all directions and there is no... a person

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:48.220
who is that dissipated in the sense of energy and in the sense of desires.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:54.980
He has many desires that he dissipates at will.

01:46:54.980 --> 01:47:03.740
There is no steady, compact, concentrated impulse.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:06.940
It is all dissipated.

01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:13.080
But what we will say to him is this.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.820
Are you going to play a tape for him?

01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:23.780
I think it might be better if you simply give him a quote and then just tell him that the

01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.020
tape is with a woman or whatever.

01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:36.040
Because I do not feel that he needs to be chastised.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:45.440
This problem is similar to many people. He's drawn to the spiritual world because he seeks

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:56.360
to avoid responsibility. And he feels that if you are a spiritual seeker, then you can

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:04.720
overlook many of the mundane responsibilities that a human body is expected to perform.

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:16.920
My advice to him is to spend a considerable amount of time looking within and finding

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:24.160
the thing that at the moment it seems to him he most wants to do, whatever it may be.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:30.040
On the physical plane now I'm speaking, I'm speaking in terms of work, in terms of job,

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:39.200
type of thing. And whatever he decides to make a vow within himself that for five years

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:49.640
he will remain with it. Five years. And stay with it. And in that time, to not indulge

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:55.320
in mind fantasies of what he would like to be doing, but to keep the power. Do you see

01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:01.320
what we're aiming at, that if he can keep himself in a compact situation, if he has promised

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:06.600
that he, himself, if he has promised himself that he will remain in a certain place for

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:15.920
five years, he will draw to him the concentrated, compact consciousness that is the primary

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:25.200
prerequisite before you can even begin the most elementary stages of a spiritual quest.

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.200
And you see, this gentleman doesn't have it.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:33.200
And one of the reasons he doesn't have it is his continual moving from place to place and thing to thing and person to person

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.200
and thought to thought and fantasy to fantasy.

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.200
He needs to become compact.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.200
So, five years, one job.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.200
That's it.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.200
And no fantasies.

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.200
Please make this very clear to him.

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:53.560
It will not do him any good to stay in one thing for five years, gritting his teeth with

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:58.240
the determination of "I hate this, I don't want to be here, I wish I were doing A, B

01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.800
and C."

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:07.820
The idea is to get his mind so concentrated on what he is doing that he would be able to

01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:15.880
perceive the joy that is inherent in any occupation.

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.500
In any occupation.

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:29.300
is inherent in it, a spontaneous joy, a spontaneous enjoyment, participation, all things are possible

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:36.820
in any position, you see. So this would be our advice to him, a five-year commitment

01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:45.840
and see if he can work for it. Now make no other statements around it, for example, please

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:52.840
don't say, "Five years commitment to one woman," for example. That would be extremely unwise.

01:50:52.840 --> 01:51:00.600
And do not in any way please stress disciplines, like whatever he chooses to do on that periphery

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.400
is really not important. It will be sufficient unto the day if he will be able to do this

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:13.400
one thing of finding the spontaneous joy and creation and creative response in one job

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.080
for five years.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.080
Yes, yes.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.080
Now the woman has a question.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:26.080
What would help her to overcome her oversensitive reactions

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.080
when negativity is directed at her?

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:35.080
Well, that's a good question because it's plagued her for many years.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:40.080
Basically, she needs to understand one thing.

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:49.040
The negativity that comes from others to her is essentially not terribly important.

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:55.920
She tends to feel that things are more important than they really are.

01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:01.760
Someone will say something to her, the person who says it to her is perhaps being very casual

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:07.560
about it and doesn't even think about it in the next five minutes, but she herself

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:12.560
has taken it in and broods on it and worries on it and so forth, you see.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.560
Now, this is an old habit and can easily be broken and it must be broken

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.560
and it's in the process of being broken.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.560
And the step that she has to take is the minute that she feels,

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.560
for example, someone says something to her that hurts,

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:40.380
makes her feel unworthy or depressed or inferior or there are many things that one could feel.

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:44.700
And by the way this applies to many people and not just to the woman herself.

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:52.720
The first thing, the first thing that should cross her conscious mind is "I choose not

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.840
to dwell on this."

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:59.520
Then, if she still feels the pull of that kind of...

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.720
because all it is is an indulgence in a negative kind of a thought situation,

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:09.080
then all she has to do is to say, "I choose to dwell in..."

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.320
and then pick something else, whatever is most joyful for her.

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:22.000
In her case, most definitely, just to choose to dwell in the presence of God,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:31.000
which is very much what she does most of the time, is try to feel, even to the physical feeling of the God Presence around her.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:40.000
She is moving into that kind of an awareness and is able often to feel the pulsations of the higher forces directly around her.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
And if she will just make a conscious choice of saying, "I don't choose that," you see,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.800
see, and then not to continue to think on these things, to drop it and to select, to choose

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:55.280
this other and to move into those feelings. I think she will find in, I would predict

01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:01.680
in weeks, not months, in weeks, excuse me, that she would be able to drop that. And I

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:07.540
would suggest to other people who might have access to this data, the same process. Each

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:13.240
time something comes into your consciousness, you have a choice. You can take it in and

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.200
become obsessed with it and deal with it and worry about it, or you can say, "I choose

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:23.320
something else," and select whatever it is that brings light to your mind rather than

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:30.320
darkness. It's simply a choice. If a symbol of the void is beautiful, that should be dwelt

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.840
on. If the light or the cross or the Christ or the whatever, those symbols should be...

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:41.920
that is what they're for. Those symbols of the world are there for you to use, and that's

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.920
That's the kind of time that we ask you to use them.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:52.920
We would also like your opinion on the Course in Miracles that she's following at this time.

01:54:52.920 --> 01:55:00.920
Well, I think it's a wonderful thing. And I highly encourage her in all aspects of it.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:06.920
Now, it is not for everyone, and she must be aware that there will be much criticism,

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.920
In ensuing years, there will be a controversy over this Course,

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.920
because it professes, as you know, to come from the Christ himself,

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.920
and there will be a great deal of controversy.

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:21.920
Now, she has thought about this herself,

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.920
and the answer for her is,

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:31.920
I believe you're all aware of the fact that the Course says that it is Jesus himself that speaks.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.920
And, in a sense, this is absolutely true.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:41.920
There is nothing in that Course that does not come from the highest source of the Christ vibration.

01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:51.920
Now, it is really not important to say, "Does it come from the persona that we consider to be Jesus?"

01:55:51.920 --> 01:56:02.000
There is nothing that is in that course that does not reflect the highest, the highest

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.600
that the Christ as personified by Jesus has to offer.

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.120
And she can go into it without any trepidation whatsoever.

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.840
Many people will not understand it.

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.440
I do not encourage her to talk about it.

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:26.380
I think that she should, especially around very orthodox Christians, should make absolutely

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.960
no mention of it.

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:34.840
They will do what they can to undermine it, and she should just let them go on their way,

01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:40.740
because everybody needs what they need, and this is a very definite response to her soul

01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:43.440
call for guidance.

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.700
And I use it often to connect with her, because she believes in it.

01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:54.780
You see, she responded immediately to the deep truths that lie there, and she is able to

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:59.020
throw out the extraneous and to dwell on the essence of it.

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:03.220
And this is why for her it is so very vital that she continue with it, because she is

01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:12.540
able out of all the pages and pages to pick those kernels that are the highest and to begin

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:19.720
to believe what it is that she needs to believe, that she is, you see, a part of this whole

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.720
drama of God. So yes, by all means.

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.720
You mentioned the persona of Jesus. If what you said about our changing constantly, the

01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:34.920
persona of Jesus no longer exists, but the Christ would exist.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:42.960
The persona of Jesus is in a sense so much more powerful, so much more radiant, so much

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:50.160
more awe-inspiring than it was two thousand years ago, that were we to meet him on the

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:57.000
earth plane today as they did then, it is doubtful that any physical vehicle could encompass.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.620
I mean, he too has moved to realms, you see.

01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.960
There is no end.

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:11.840
It is hard to explain, but there is no end to the capacity to expand into the total Godness.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.840
Did you want me to stop?

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:24.560
There is no end to the infinite, and the persona of Jesus in the two thousand years since he

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:33.360
left the earth plane has continued to radiate and to grow in light and wisdom that those

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:39.880
who tune into him now are given so much more than they were two thousand years ago.

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.260
Do you see?

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:50.000
Because he himself has moved through, he is so much closer to the totality of things than

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.360
he was then, that his gift throughout the centuries increases. You see, it's so funny, the world

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:05.520
says two thousand years ago and puts him as an old archaic form. In truth, he is so much

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:13.520
more now than he ever was that he is an even greater gift to mankind now than he was then,

01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:23.960
you see, and it is so opposite. He is the source that I draw to. He is the source that I look

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:33.960
to for my wisdom. And in my states of exaltation, I do my very best to reach the heights that

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:43.240
He was a two thousand years ago, you see, and he has so far transcended that now that someone

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:49.400
like myself could walk the plane, the earth plane now, and be considered on that vibrational

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.600
level, but not him.

01:59:51.600 --> 02:00:02.200
If he came back in the form that he was, I mean that he is now, well, we won't even speculate

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.760
about that.

02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.760
Are there any questions in the room?

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.760
Yes, I have a question.

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:13.760
Would you speak on the subject of the second coming of the Christ?

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:25.760
Well, again, there's been an awful lot of misinformation filtered through various peoples on this subject.

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:31.760
And it is true that he will come again, and blessed is the world that this is so.

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:40.120
Now, when we say "He will come again," it is so hard to put into words, but as I try

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:45.640
to explain, the physical vehicle that walked the earth two thousand years ago, it was a
